% Abstract: switch emphasis/ordering to talk about 
%probabilistic classification, how this is useful for situation awareness mapping/classifying the situation on the ground using heatmaps/
% these maps can be generated using probabilistic classification techniques such as 
% GPs that can interpolate between observations and fold in background knowledge, giving
% not only estimates of probability across an entire area, but also providing a measure of
% uncertainy. Often in these situations, the information comes form multiple, unreliable 
% sources. For example...
% Current methods for probbilistic classifiaction do not provide a way to combine this
% unreliable information into a single heatmap.

% Why did we choose the values in the synthetic dataset. These are typical values in situation x. 

% Move paragraph to intro "In scenarios such as disaster response...". Perhaps mention this when we talk about GP. "Damage is typically spread over a region" Where damage occurs, this is typically widespread, with whole areas affected to a similar degree, so that a single report gives an indication of the likely state in the whole area. As we move FURTHER away from the report location.

% Abstract:

%Social media enables members of the public to post realtime text messages, photographs and 
%videos describing events taking place close to them. While many of these reports may be 
%irrelevant, social media can provide a stream of up-to-date information across a wide area when 
%other sources are limited. Information about a region of interest may also be contained in other %types of unstructured data, such as satellite images. 
Unstructured data from sources such as social media and aerial imagery can provide 
valuable up-to-date information for learning about the situation in an area of interest.
Mining these different information sources could bring major benefits to applications such as situation awareness in disaster zones and mapping the spread of diseases.
Such applications depend on classifying the situation across a region of interest, which can be
depicted as a ``heatmap". By annotating the unstructured data using crowdsourcing or automated feature extraction, it is possible to obtain classifications at specific locations, but these are typically sparse and contain many errors.
Probabilistic techniques for generating heatmaps, such as Gaussian process classifiers, interpolate between sparse observations, fold in background knowledge, and provide estimates of parameter uncertainty that indicate where more information may be needed. However, current methods fail to account for differing relevance, error rates and bias when combining information from multiple, heterogeneous, data sources or crowds of annotators. 

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach that models the reliability of each information source, enabling us to learn a spatio-temporal Gaussian Process classifier by aggregating data from sources with varying reliability and relevance. 
%Our method integrates Bayesian classifier combination techniques to learn a reliability model for 
%each information source without the need for 
Our method does not require ground truth training data, and can make predictions at any location in an area of interest given only sparse observations.
%enable 
%We thereby provide a tool for mining sparse, heterogeneous, crowdsourced data, which can infer 
%the state at any location in an area of interest and quantify the uncertainty in that state.
%
%, such as those from experienced first responders attending a disaster zone.
 We show empirically that our approach effectively deals with noisy and biased data sources, and that simultaneously inferring reliability and transferring information between neighbouring reports leads to more accurate predictions.
 We demonstrate our method on two real-world problems from disaster response, 
 showing how our approach effectively reduces the cost of crowdsourcing, handles data sparsity,
and can be used to generate heatmap visualisations.
 % Finally, we illustrate the use of this approach for presenting spatial, probabilistic ``heatmap" 
 %visualisations to improve situation awareness.
