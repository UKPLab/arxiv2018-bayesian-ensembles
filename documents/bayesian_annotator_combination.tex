\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a Bayesian method for combining sequence classifications from multiple annotators with different levels of noise and class bias. Sequential classification is an important problem in fields such as NLP, where many tasks involve annotating spans of text. 
In such tasks, crowdsourcing is often used to obtain training data for automated classifiers. However, individual human annotators have highly variable error rates and different automated classifiers often produce different patterns of errors. In both cases, errors can be reduced by combining multiple annotators.
However, while Bayesian methods have proved effective in combining unreliable classifiers, they have not previously taken into account the sequence of classifications and are therefore unable to incorporate rules that restrict which labels may follow each other, such as with BIO encoding. We propose a new method that incorporates sequence information using hidden Markov models, and show how the priors can be set to capture sequence rules. We analyse performance against established classifier combination methods on synthetic data to show the effects of annotator accuracy, bias and crowd size on performance. We further evaluate the methods on two NLP datasets: crowdsourced annotations of argument components; and predictions of argument components from an ensemble of neural network classifiers. The results show the advantage of modelling sequential dependencies between labels. We make our source code and data available online.
