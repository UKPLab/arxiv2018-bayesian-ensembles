\begin{abstract}
Current methods for sequence tagging, a core task in NLP, are data hungry,
which motivates the use of crowdsourcing as a relatively cheap way to obtain labeled data.
However, annotators are often unreliable and current aggregation methods cannot capture common types of span annotation error
as they ignore sequential dependencies between annotators' labels.
To address this, we propose a Bayesian method for aggregating sequential annotations 
 that reduces errors by modelling sequential dependencies between the
 annotations as well as ground-truth labels.
By taking a Bayesian approach, we account for uncertainty in model due to errors in the annotations or a lack of data from crowdworkers who complete few tasks.
We evaluate our model on crowdsourced data for named entity recognition, information extraction and argument mining,
showing that our sequential model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, 
and that Bayesian approaches outperform alternatives.
We also find that our approach enables more effective active learning
by better capturing uncertainty in the sequence labels when there are few annotations.
