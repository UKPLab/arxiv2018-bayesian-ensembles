% This paper shows how common annotator models for crowdsourcing can be seen as extensions of one another

\begin{abstract}
Current methods for sequence tagging, a core task in NLP, are data hungry,
which motivates the use of crowdsourcing as a cheap way to obtain labelled data.
However, annotators are often unreliable and current aggregation methods cannot capture common types of span annotation errors.
%, as they ignore sequential dependencies between annotators' labels.
To address this, we propose a Bayesian method for aggregating sequence tags
 that reduces errors by modelling sequential dependencies between the
 annotations as well as the ground-truth labels.
By taking a Bayesian approach, we account for uncertainty in the model due to both
annotator errors and 
the lack of data for modelling annotators who complete few tasks.
We evaluate our model on crowdsourced data for named entity recognition, information extraction and argument mining,
showing that our sequential model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. 
%and that 
%Bayesian approaches outperform non-Bayesian alternatives.
We also find that
 our approach can reduce crowdsourcing costs through
 more effective active learning, as it 
better captures uncertainty in the sequence labels when there are few annotations.
