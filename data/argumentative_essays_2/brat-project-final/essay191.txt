For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group.

Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. 
When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying.
