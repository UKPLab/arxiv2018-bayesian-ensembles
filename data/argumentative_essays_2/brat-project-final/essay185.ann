T1	MajorClaim 163 244	new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal
T2	Claim 255 335	due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 337 436	Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford
T4	Premise 457 512	fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas
T5	Premise 527 725	it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms
T6	Premise 732 844	the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming

R5	attacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8	
T7	Premise 1008 1163	Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards
T10	Premise 1178 1311	the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams
T11	Premise 1313 1377	This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds
T12	Premise 1397 1581	the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations

T14	Claim 1652 1781	contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming
A4	Stance T14 Against
T15	Premise 1783 1875	these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions
T16	Premise 1889 1982	we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain
T17	Premise 1984 2083	These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy
