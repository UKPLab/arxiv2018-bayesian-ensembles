This readme covers the subset of data in this directory used in the BAC experiments.
The folder brat-project-final contains the data for the brat annotation tool
project, along with the original text and the gold-standard annotations.

Gold standard was found by resolving disagreements between the three annotators.

The original annotations from each annotator are in the folder Step1. Not all
documents were annotated by these annotators -- only the 80 documents identified
as test data by train-test-split.csv. The others can be ignored for the purposes
of the BAC experiments.
