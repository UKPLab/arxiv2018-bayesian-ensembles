Huge

fail

Martin

SEATTLE
1996-08-22
A
year
after
its
massively
publicized
introduction
","
Microsoft
Corp.
's
Windows
95
computer
operating
system
has
fallen
short
of
the
most
optimistic
expectations
for
the
software
giant
and
the
industry
.
Even
though
more
than
40
million
copies
of
Windows
95
have
been
sold
","
making
it
the
fastest-selling
new
software
ever
","
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
product
to
live
up
to
the
unprecedented
hype
of
the
Aug.
24
","
1995
launch
","
when
stores
around
the
world
opened
at
midnight
to
greet
long
lines
of
customers
.
The
Redmond
","
Wash.-based
company
spent
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
promoting
the
product
with
stunts
that
included
buying
the
entire
print
run
of
the
Times
of
London
and
lighting
New
York
's
Empire
State
building
in
a
Windows
color
scheme
.
But
the
product
","
delivered
eight
months
late
","
has
fallen
short
of
its
sales
potential
in
part
because
Microsoft
delivered
a
mixed
message
to
business
customers
","
analysts
said
.
It
did
n't
do
as
well
as
it
could
have
","
said
Rob
Enderle
","
an
analyst
with
Giga
Information
Group
.
Scores
of
software
and
hardware
companies
that
had
hoped
for
a
big
boost
in
sales
were
disappointed
when
only
a
brief
spike
materialized
.
People
who
were
expecting
major
coat-tails
were
somewhat
disappointed
","
said
Scott
Winkler
","
an
analyst
with
Gartner
Group
.
It
's
not
as
though
it
has
n't
had
an
impact
","
he
said
.
It
just
has
n't
had
the
huge
earth-shattering
impact
some
people
were
looking
for
.
Symantec
Corp.
","
which
had
been
among
the
most
bullish
of
software
companies
at
the
time
of
the
Windows
95
launch
","
ended
up
posting
disappointing
financial
results
when
retail
sales
of
the
operating
system
fell
short
of
its
projections
.
Touchstone
Software
Corp.
had
to
pay
$
1.3
million
in
cash
and
stock
to
settle
a
shareholders
lawsuit
brought
after
the
company
's
sales
failed
to
meet
expectations
tied
to
the
Windows
95
launch
.
Many
software
developers
apparently
saw
their
crucial
holiday
season
sales
suffer
last
year
because
store
shelves
were
jammed
with
blue-and-white
boxes
of
Windows
95
","
resulting
in
a
shortage
of
space
for
seasonal
products
","
said
Ann
Stephens
","
president
of
PC
Data
Inc
.
To
be
sure
","
sales
of
Windows
95
and
the
accompanying
Office
95
upgrade
drove
Microsoft
sales
up
46
percent
last
year
to
a
record
$
8.67
billion
and
cemented
the
company
's
status
as
the
industry
's
dominant
company
.
Microsoft
executives
say
they
are
thrilled
with
the
sales
figures
","
and
industry
analysts
estimate
that
by
sometime
next
year
","
the
installed
base
of
Windows
95
will
surpass
that
of
the
older
version
of
Windows
","
now
used
on
about
100
million
computers
worldwide
.
But
Enderle
said
the
figure
could
have
been
even
higher
if
Microsoft
had
done
a
better
job
of
handling
the
huge
demand
for
technical
support
from
customers
who
were
frustrated
trying
to
install
the
system
.
He
and
other
analysts
said
corporate
America
adopted
a
go-slow
approach
because
Microsoft
already
was
promoting
the
new
version
of
its
high-end
Windows
NT
operating
system
","
expected
to
be
available
in
stores
in
the
next
several
weeks
.
Microsoft
sent
a
lot
of
signals
that
NT
was
going
to
be
the
answer
","
Winkler
said
.
Many
people
began
to
believe
that
Windows
95
was
being
downplayed
.
But
now
that
Windows
NT
4.0
has
been
launched
","
Winkler
and
others
believe
only
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
corporate
users
will
elect
to
pay
the
added
software
and
hardware
costs
needed
to
use
it
instead
of
Windows
95
.
Windows
95
is
going
to
do
great
","
he
said
.
The
mistake
people
made
was
in
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
a
fast
","
sweeping
change
rather
than
a
slow
","
building
change

President
Leonid

said
in

statement
this

.
Unlike
many
other
post-Soviet
countries
we
were
able
to
deal
with
conflict
situations
in
a
peaceful
and
civilised
way
.
But
independence
was
initially
accompanied
by
hyper-inflation
and
economic
collapse
","
although
there
are
signs
of
a
turnaround
.
Inflation
--
a
hyper-inflationary
"10,300"
percent
a
year
in
1993
--
was
a
respectable
0.1
percent
a
month

June

July
and
the
economy
has
just
begun
to
grow
.
Kuchma
told
a
solemn
ceremony
at
the
Ukraina
Palace
on
Friday
that
there
was
a
turning
point
in
reforms
and
that
he
expected
a
rise
in
the
standard
of
living
in
the
near
future
.
There
is
no

that
economic
growth
has
already
started

Knobl
","

The
national

and
the
government
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
their
efforts
.
Central
bank
officials
said
on
Thursday
that
a
much-postponed
hryvna
currency
would
definitely
be
introduced
before
the
end
of
this
year

It
will
replace
the
interim
karbovanets
currency
","
which
was
introduced
at
par
to
the
Russian
rouble
in
1992
but
now
trades
at
almost
33
karbovanets
per
rouble
.
Ukraine
has
repeatedly
promised
to
introduce
the
hryvna
but
had
to
postpone
the
plans
because
of
economic
problems
.

overreacting
.
But
Ukraine
","
seeing
itself
as
a
bridge
between
Russia

the
rapidly
Westernising
countries
of
eastern
Europe
","
is
looking
West

Relations
with
Russia
","
which
is
our
main
partner
","

great
importance

Kuchma

But
Ukraine
cannot
be
economically
oriented

Russia
","
even
though
those

some
circles
push
us

four
years
in
prison

pumping
banned
extremist
propaganda
into

base

a
tirade

abuse

the
court
after
his
conviction
for
inciting
racial
hatred

The
struggle

go
on
","
the
43-year-old
shouted
in
German
before
being
escorted
out
by
security
guards

Lauck
's
lawyer
vowed
he
would
appeal
against
the
court
's
decision
","
arguing
that
his
client
should
have
been
set
free
because
he
had
not
committed
any
offence
under
German
law
.
The
German
government
hailed
the
conviction
as
a
major
victory
in
the
fight
against
neo-Nazism
.
Lauck
's
worldwide
network
has
been
the
main
source
of
anti-Semitic
propaganda
material
flowing
into
Germany
since
the
1970s
.
Lauck
possessed
a
well-oiled
propaganda
machine
","
honed
during
more
than
20
years
","
presiding
judge
Guenter
Bertram
told
the
court
.
He
set
up
a
propaganda
cannon
and
fired
it
at

said
Bertram
","
who
also
read
out
extracts
from
Lauck
's
material
praising
Hitler
as
the
greatest
of
all
leaders
and
describing
the
Nazi
slaughter
of
millions
of
Jews
as
a
myth
.
Eager
to
put
Lauck
behind
bars
quickly
and
avoid
a
long
and
complex
trial
","
prosecutor
Bernd
Mauruschat
limited
his
charges
to
offences
since
1994
.
He
had
demanded
a
five-year
jail
term
but
said
he
was
satisfied
with
the
court
's
sentence
.
Publishing
and
distributing
neo-Nazi
material
is
illegal
in
Germany
but
Lauck
's
defence
team
had
argued
that
U.S
freedom
of
speech
laws
meant
he
was
free
to
produce
his
swastika-covered
books
","
magazines
","
videos
and
flags
in
his
homeland
.
Interior
Minister
Manfred
Kanther
said
in
a
statement
he
welcomed
the
prosecution
and
conviction
of
one
of
the
ringleaders
of
international
neo-Nazism
and
biggest
distributers
of
vicious
racist
publications
.

is

time

bars

Democrats

statement

Lauck
","
dressed
in
a
sober
blue
suit
and
sporting
his
trademark
Hitleresque
black
moustache
","
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
as
Bertram
spent
more
than
an
hour
reading
out
the
verdict
and
explaining
the
court
's
decision
.
But
as
Lauck
was
about
to
be
led
away
","
he
turned
to
reporters
and
blurted
out
a
virtually
incomprehensible
quick-fire
diatribe
against
the
court
.
Neither
the
National
Socialists
(
Nazis
)
nor
the
communists
dared
to
kidnap
an
American
citizen
","
he
shouted
","
in
an
oblique
reference
to
his
extradition
to
Germany
from
Denmark
.
That
's
the
truth
.
His
attorney
","
Hans-Otto
Sieg
","
told
reporters
outside
the
courtroom
that
the
judges
had
not
explained
how
a
German
court
could
judge
someone
for
actions
carried
out
in
the
United
States
.
Bertram
said
Lauck
was
obsessed
by
Nazism
and
devoted
his
life
to
leading
his
National
Socialist
German
Workers
'
Party
Foreign
Organisation
(
NSDAP-AO
)
","
which
derives
its
name
from
the
full
German
title
of
Hitler
's
Nazi
party
.
During
the
three-month
trial
","
the
court
dealt
mainly
with
issues
of
the
NSDAP-AO
's
NS
Kampfruf
(
National
Socialist
Battle
Cry
)
magazine
","
filled
with
references
to
Aryan
supremacy
and
defamatory
statements
about
Jews
.
The
court
rejected
Sieg
's
argument
that
Lauck
's
extradition
from
Denmark
","
where
he
was
arrested
in
March
last
year
at
the
request
of
German
authorities
","
was
illegal
.
Lauck
was
also
convicted
of
disseminating
the
symbols
of
anti-constitutional
organisations
.
He
will
probably
be
free
in
around
two
and
a
half
years
.
The
court
ruled
that
the
15
months
he
has
spent
in
custody
since
his
arrest
should
be
subtracted
from
his
prison
term

SYDNEY
1996-08-23
World
number
one
golfer
Greg
Norman
has
sacked
his
coach
Butch
Harmon
after
a
disappointing
season
.
Butch
and
I
are
finished
","
Norman
told
reporters
on
Thursday
before
the
start
of
the
World
Series
of
Golf
in
Akron
","
Ohio
.
Norman
","
a
two-time
British
Open
champion
","
parted
ways
with
his
long-time
mentor
after
drawing
a
blank
in
this
year
's
four
majors
","
winning
two
tournaments
worldwide
.
The
blonde
Australian
opened
with
a
level
par
round
of
70
in
Akron
","
leaving
him
four
shots
adrift
of
the
leaders
","
Americans
Billy
Mayfair
and
Paul
Goydos
and
Japan
's
Hidemichi
Tanaki
.
On
Wednesday
Norman
described
this
year
as
his
worst
on
the
professional
circuit
since
1991
","
when
he
failed
to
win
a
tournament
.
My
application
this
year
has
been
strange
","
Norman
said
.
Maybe
I
have
n't
been
as
keyed
up
as
I
should
have
been
.
Sometimes
you
do
n't
have
it
in
your
head
to
play
.
Maybe
this
was
one
of
those
years
where
I
was
there
","
but
I
was

German
farm
ministry
tells
consumers
to
avoid
British
mutton
.
BONN
1996-08-22
Germany
's
Agriculture
Ministry
suggested
on
Wednesday
that
consumers
avoid
eating
meat
from
British
sheep
until
scientists
determine
whether
mad
cow
disease
can
be
transmitted
to
the
animals
.
Until
this
is
cleared
up
by
the
European
Union
's
scientific
panels
--
and
we
have
asked
this
to
be
done
as
quickly
as
possible
--
(
consumers
)
should
if
at
all
possible
give
preference
to
sheepmeat
from
other
countries
","
ministry
official
Werner
Zwingmann
told
ZDF
television
.
I
do
not
want
to
say
that
there
is
a
concrete
danger
for
consumers
","
he
added
.
There
are
too
many
holes
in
what
we
know
","
and
these
must
be
filled
very
quickly
.
Bonn
has
led
efforts
to
ensure
consumer
protection
tops
the
list
of
priorities
in
dealing
with
the
mad
cow
crisis
","
which
erupted
in
March
when
Britain
acknowledged
humans
could
contract
a
similar
illness
by
eating
contaminated
beef
.
The
European
Commission
agreed
this
month
to
rethink
a
proposal
to
ban
the
use
of
suspect
sheep
tissue
after
some
EU
veterinary
experts
questioned
whether
it
was
justified
.
EU
Farm
Commissioner
Franz
Fischler
had
proposed
banning
sheep
brains
","
spleens
and
spinal
cords
from
the
human
and
animal
food
chains
after
reports
from
Britain
and
France
that
under
laboratory
conditions
sheep
could
contract
Bovine
Spongiform
Encephalopathy
(
BSE
)
--
mad
cow
disease
.
But
some
members
of
the
EU
's
standing
veterinary
committee
questioned
whether
the
action
was
necessary
given
the
slight
risk
to
human
health
.
The
question
is
being
studied
separately
by
two
EU
scientific
committees
.
Sheep
have
long
been
known
to
contract
scrapie
","
a
similar
brain-wasting
disease
to
BSE
which
is
believed
to
have
been
transferred
to
cattle
through
feed
containing
animal
waste
.
British
officials
say
sheep
meat
is
perfectly
safe
to
eat
.
ZDF
said
Germany
imported
"47,600"
sheep
from
Britain
last
year
","
nearly
half
of
total
imports
.
It
brought
in
"4,275"
tonnes
of
British
mutton
","
some
10
percent
of
overall
imports
.
After
the
British
government
admitted
a
possible
link
between
mad
cow
disease
and
its
fatal
human
equivalent
","
the
EU
imposed
a
worldwide
ban
on
British
beef
exports
.
EU
leaders
agreed
at
a
summit
in
June
to
a
progressive
lifting
of
the
ban
as
Britain
takes
parallel
measures
to
eradicate
the
disease

at
this
"1,750-hectare"
(
"4,325-acre"
)
farm
in
the
grain-growing
regions
south
of
Kiev
do
n't
fill
its
chief
agronomist
with
enthusiasm
.
They
did
a
good
job
this
year
","
but
they
need
good
diesel
and
good
engine
oil
","
said
Ivan
Odnosum
.
God
help
us
if
there
is
a
breakdown
","
he
said
of
the
machinery
","
loaned
to
the
farm
after
the
Ukrainian
government
bought
it
earlier
this
year
.
The
country
's
grain
harvest
this
year
is
forecast
to
fall
by
more
than
23
percent
to
only
28
million
tonnes
and
two
harsh
factors
are
to
blame
.
A
drought
scoured
the
steppes
in
May
and
June
","
stunting
the
growing
wheat
.
And
the
farming
sector
","
making
the
painful
transition
from
Soviet
central
planning
to
a
market
economy
simply
has
no
money
.
Ukraine
's
black
soil
is
so
fertile
that
a
diplomat
described
it
as
rich
enough
to
grow
rubber
boots
.
But
recently
Ukraine
has
been
losing
its
reputation
as
a
breadbasket
of
Europe
","
earned
in
the
years
before
brutal
forced
collectivisation
under
Soviet
dictator
Josef
Stalin
.
The
wheat
will
not
be
of
a
good
quality
this
year
","
said
Hryhory
Borsuk
","
a
scientist
at
the
Mironivka
Wheat
Institute
","
run
by
the
Ukrainian
Academy
of
Agrarian
Sciences
.
The
temperature
on
the
ground
reached
62
decrees
Celsius
(
143.60
Fahrenheit
)
this
summer
.
We
've
never
seen
anything
so
bad
","
he
said
in
an
interview
in
his
office
","
unlit
since
the
government
cut
off
electricity
because
of
unpaid
power
bills
.
The
harvest
is
gathered
in
the
dry
areas
","
but
rainfall
in
Western
Ukraine
has
delayed
harvesting
there
.
While
Mironivka
's
scientists
","
some
unpaid
for
months
","
carry
on
developing
new
strains
of
wheat
resistant
to
Ukraine
's
extreme
continental
climate
","
Borsuk
said
the
lack
of
cash
in
Ukraine
's
agricultural
sector
is
as
bad
as
the
drought
.
Collective
farms
and
Ukraine
's
nascent
private
farming
sector
have
no
money
for
fertiliser
","
no
money
for
herbicides
and
pesticides
","
no
money
to
repair
old
or
buy
new
machinery
","
no
money
for
fuel
","
and
none
to
buy
good
seed
.
This
year
's
harvest
is
down
from
last
year
's
36.5
million
tonne
harvest
","
which
in
turn
compares
with
50
million
tonnes
in
1990
","
the
year
before
independence
.
The
decline
is
all
the
worse
for
people
who
recall
wasteful
Soviet
times
","
when
the
Kremlin
imported
grain
but
priced
bread
so
cheaply
that
people
bought
it
to
feed
their
pigs
.
Agriculture
is
very
expensive
","
and
there
are
no
solutions
to
our
problems
on
the
horizon
","
said
Odnosum
.
He
said
his
farm
","
its
260
workers
now
readying
the
fields
for
winter
wheat
sowing
","
expected
the
land
to
yield
5.2
tonnes
per
hectare
(
2.5
acres
)
but
ended
up
with
3.9
tonnes
--
still
better
than
the
national
average
of
2.11
tonnes
per
hectare
this
year
.
We
did
not
have
money
for
fertiliser
","
we
're
in
debt
for
fuel
","
and
we
're
borrowing
diesel
","
Odnosum
said
.
A
few
kilometres
(
miles
)
down
the
two-lane
road
which
passes
Odnosum
's
farm
","
where
the
occasional
horse-drawn
buggy
passes
by
","
is
the
"1,700-hectare"
(
"4,200-acre"
)
Shevchenko
collective
farm
","
built
next
to
a
village
still
neat
and
tidy
despite
post-Soviet
decay
.
Chief
Accountant
Natalya
Sypron
said
the
collective
is
strapped
for
cash
","
earlier
this
year

220
tonnes
of
grain

fuel

(
$
800
-
$
"1,000"
)
--
but
many
have
not
been
paid
in
months
","
Soprun
said
.
People
are
working
out
of
their
own
dedication
.
Borsuk
said
the
farm
sector
has
two
options
:
We
can
sit
down
and
cry
","
or
we
can
do
something
.
He
said
the
government
plans
to
increase
the
sowing
of
the
winter
wheat
which
will
be
harvested
next
year
.
Planted
in
late
summer
and
early
autumn
","
the
grain
is
Ukraine
's
largest
export
item
and
traditionally
grows
better
than
summer
wheat
in
Ukraine
's
soil
.
Further
plans
","
he
said
","
called
for
full
provision
of
resources
like
fertiliser
and
herbicides
for
25
percent
of
Ukraine
's
arable
land
next
year
","
for
50
percent
in
1998
and
100
percent
of
the
land
in
1999
.
If
we
follow
this
we
'll
be
able
to
sell
10
million
tonnes
of
grain
by
the
year
2000
","
Borkus
said
.
The
government
has
been
trying
to
phase
out
huge
subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
","
and
in
a
move
back
to
pre-Soviet
days
has
given
up
to
50
hectares
(
124
acres
)
of
land
to
some
"36,000"
private
farmers
willing
to
go
it
alone
.
Collective
farms
will
last
for
the
next
few
years
","
because
most
private
farms
now
only
produce
enough
to
feed
themselves
with
maybe
a
little
extra
to
sell
","
said
one
private
farmer
:
In
the
future
","
maybe
","
but
it
's
better
not
to
hurry
.
Collectivisation
brought
us
a
lot
of
pain
.
And
it
went
too
fast
.
Privatising
too
quickly
can
also
have
a
negative
outcome

China
copper
stocks
owned

Lynne

KONG
1996-08-23
Up
to
"100,000"
tonnes
of
copper
held
in
Shanghai
bonded
warehouses
","
confounding
the
world
market
as
to
its
source
and
ultimate
fate
","
probably
belongs
to
China
's
strategic
state
reserve
","
industry
sources
said
on
Friday
.
Around
"40,000"
tonnes
of
the
copper
have
already
been
moved
to
warehouses
near
the
northern
port
of
Yingkou
","
where
some
of
the
strategic
stockpile
was
stored
","
they
said
.
Just
who
owns
the
copper
is
a
question
that
has
kept
traders
and
industry
analysts
guessing
since
the
metal
was
channelled
into
Shanghai
by
the
China
National
Nonferrous
Metals
Import
and
Export
Corp
(
CNIEC
)
in
June
and
July
.
It
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
"40,000"
tonnes
had
cleared
customs
--
which
would
provide
some
concrete
indication
that
the
strategic
reserve
","
administered
directly
by
the
central
government
's
State
Planning
Commission
","
owned
the
copper
.
Traders
have
said
the
reserve
could
negotiate
concessions
on
duties
--
three
percent
import
tax
and
17
percent
value-added
tax
--
that
made
the
copper
prohibitively
expensive
otherwise
.
But
one
source
","
the
head
of
a
Hong
Kong
trading
house
","
said
it
made
no
difference
if
the
copper
was
customs
cleared
or
not
.
If
they
spend
all
this
money
moving
the
copper
to
Yingkou
","
it
will
be
sitting
there
for
years
","
he
said
.
Once
it
arrives
in
Yingkou
","
it
is
subject
to
monitoring
by
the
State
Planning
Commission
","
which
has
to
give
permission
for
any
more
movement
;
it
is
out
of
the
hands
of
traders
","
he
said
.
Mystery
has
surrounded
the
Shanghai
stockpile
in
recent
months
","
with
traders
unsure
not
only
of
who
owns
it
","
but
of
its
exact
size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
.
Trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
cost-effective
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
long-term
backwardation
on
the
London
Metal
Exchange
(
LME
)
.
A
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
.
CNIEC
lent
around
"85,000"
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
LME
between
April
and
June
1995
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
","
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
"115,000"
tonnes
from
"200,000"
tonnes
previously
.
Traders
in
Asia
said
CNIEC
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
US$
"2,700"
a
tonne
","
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
$
"2,200"
and
$
"2,400"
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
.
This
would
have
cleared
CNIEC
a
healthy
profit
","
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
.
Word
that
CNIEC
had
offered
the
copper
to
European
trading
houses
in
a
series
of
secret
meetings
unnerved
an
already
jittery
market
.
Industry
analysts
Bloomsbury
Minerals
Economics
(
BME
)
said
on
Wednesday
the
motivation
of
the
owners
of
the
"85,000"
tonnes
","
whoever
they
are
","
is
the
most
important
short-term
fundamental
in
an
already
tight
world
market
.
BME
repeated
in
its
latest
review
rumours
of
involvement
by
Sumitomo
Corp
","
with
CNIEC
said
to
be
helping
the
Japanese
trader
unload
its
copper
positions
after
it
revealed
in
June
losses
of
$
1.8
billion
in
a
decade
of
unauthorised
deals
.
Sumitomo
and
CNIEC
have
made
no
comments
on
the
talk
and
Chinese
traders
said
they
know
nothing
of
such
an
arrangement
.
Traders
in
Shanghai
said
on
Thursday
they
were
unaware
of
movements
out
of
the
Shanghai
bonded
warehouses
.
They
reported
more
arrivals
that
were
probably
spot
purchases
.
They
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded
warehouses
would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
.
But
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
","
a
Singapore
trader
said
","
despite
a
forecast
that
domestic
Chinese
copper
demand
could
hit
one
million
tonnes
this
year
.
As
with
many
commodities
","
there
is
a
desire
(
by
the
Chinese
government
)
to
keep
a
stockpile
of
the
metal
","
he
said
.
You
do
n't
keep
it
to
help
industry
","
you
keep
it
in
case
of
emergency

16.75

He
said
the
sell-off
in

vols
might
have
been
overdone

which

offer
value
at
current
levels
.
He
said
caps

floors
would
be
well
bid
after
the
round
of
interest
rate
cuts
due
to
the
fact
these

The

Bundesbank
's

","
took
markets
by
surprise
.
Volatility
has
a
bid
to
it
--
longer-dated
volatility
more
than
short-dated
because
the
event
people
were
buying
for
has
passed
and
now
perhaps
people
will
sell
some
short
dated
vol
and
buy
some
long
dated
vol
","
he
said
.
Long
dated
volatility
has
been
low
this
year
","
so
it
is
still
at
levels
which
are
not
historically
high
.
It
is
not
a
dangerous
level
to
own
vol.
You
are
not
going
to
lose
a
lot
and
you
could
make
quite
a
bit
.
He
said
volatility
levels
should
be
stable
until
markets
reassess
the
situation
after
a
long
weekend
in
Britain

Robert
Coughlan
said
that
if
volatility
continued
lower
for
the
rest
of
Friday
in
over-the-counter
10-year
Bunds
","
it
should
be
higher
next
Tuesday
.
He
said
the
absence
on
holiday
of
many
market
makers
was
a
main
factor
behind
falls
this
week
in
volatility
in
high-yielding
markets
such
as
Italy
","
Spain
and
Sweden
.
Coughlan
said
the
market
had
more
downside
than
upside
potential
","
but
a
fall
was
not
likely
to
be
of
significant
size
.
I
recommend
people
sell
strangles
in
a
number
of
markets
--
in
Germany
and
France
in
particular
.
With
high-yielding
markets
Italy
will
be
a
lot
more
vulnerable
in
September
on
economic
and
political
fronts
","
so
I
would
use
current
the
low
level
of
vol
to
buy
options

So
sell
options

1996-08-22
India
said
on
Thursday
that
its
opposition
to
a
global
nuclear
test
ban
treaty
did
not
mean
New
Delhi
intended
to
enter
into
an
arms
race
with
neighbouring
Pakistan
and
China
.
Foreign
Minister
I.K.
Gujral
was
asked
at
a
news
conference
if
India
's
decision
to
block
adoption
of
the
accord
in
Geneva
would
lead
to
an
arms
race
with
Pakistan
and
China
.
I
do
n't
see
that
possibility
because
India
is
not
entering
into
any
arms
race
","
he
said
.
Our
not
signing
a
new
treaty
does
not
mean
we
are
going
in
for
any
new
kind
of
weapons
","
particularly
nuclear
.
China
","
along
with
Britain
","
France
","
Russia
and
the
United
States
","
is
a
declared
nuclear
power
.
India
carried
out
a
nuclear
test
in
1974
but
says
it
has
not
built
the
bomb
.
Experts
believe
both
India
and
Pakistan
could
quickly
assemble
nuclear
weapons
.
Gujral
said
he
did
not
expect
India
's
veto
of
the
Comprehensive
Test
Ban
Treaty
(
CTBT
)
to
damage
bilateral
ties
with
other
nations
.
I
do
not
visualise
its
straining
our
bilateral
relations
with
any
country
.
The
text
has
already
been
blocked
","
he
said
.
Gujral
said
India
would
re-examine
its
position
if
the
treaty
","
particularly
a
clause
providing
for
its
entry
into
force
","
was
modified
.
Asked
what
India
would
do
if
the
pact
were
forwarded
to
the
United
Nations
General
Assembly
","
Gujral
said
:
That
bridge
I
will
cross
when
I
come
to
it
.
In
a
written
statement
released
at
the
news
conference
","
Gujral
reiterated
India
's
objections
to
the
treaty
","
under
negotiation
at
the
Conference
on
Disarmament
in
Geneva
.
It
is
a
sad
fact
that
the
nuclear
weapon
states
show
no
interest
in
giving
up
their
nuclear
hegemony
","
the
statement
said
.
Gujral
said
India
had
national
security
concerns
that
made
it
impossible
for
New
Delhi
to
sign
the
CTBT
.
Our
security
concerns
oblige
us
to
maintain
our
nuclear
option
","
he
said
","
adding
that
India
had
exercised
restraint
in
not
carrying
out
any
nuclear
tests
since
the
country
's
lone
test
blast
in
1974
.
He
said
:
We
cannot
accept
constraints
on
our
option
as

as
nuclear

states
continue
to
rely
on
their
nuclear
arsenals

Garlic
pills

","
study
finds
.
LONDON
1996-08-22
Garlic
pills
may
not
lower
blood
cholesterol
and
studies
that
show
they
do
may
be
flawed
","
British
researchers
have
reported
.
A
study
by
a
team
of
doctors
at
Oxford
University
has
found
people
with
high
blood
cholesterol
do
not
benefit
significantly
from
taking
garlic
tablets
.
The
study
involved
115
people
with
high
blood
cholesterol
levels
.
They
were
given
900
milligrams
a
day
of
dried
garlic
powder
or
placebo
tablets
.
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
groups
receiving
garlic
and
placebo
","
they
wrote
in
the
Journal
of
the
Royal
College
of
Physicians
.
Those
taking
part
were
told
to
eat
a
low-fat
diet
for
six
weeks
before
they
started
taking
the
pills
","
and
their
blood
cholesterol
measured
before
and
after
the
six-week
period
.
The
researchers
said
this
would
make
their
findings
more
accurate
.
Several
studies
have
found
garlic
pills
can
lower
blood
pressure
and
blood
cholesterol
.
But
the
Oxford
team
disputed
these
findings
and
said
either
previous
trials
may
have
been
interpreted
incorrectly
","
those
taking
part
were
not
given
special
diets
beforehand
or
the
duration
of
the
studies
may
have
been
too
short
.
The
six-month
trial
was
funded
by
the
British
Heart
Foundation
and
Lichtwer
Pharma
GmbH
","
which

The
study
did
not
address
whether
whole
garlic
could
affect
cholesterol

INJURED

OUT
OF

NEW
YORK
1996-08-23
Promising
10th-ranked
American
Chanda
Rubin
has
pulled
out
of
the
U.S.
Open
Tennis
Championships
with
a
wrist
injury
","
tournament
officials
announced
.
The
20-year-old
Rubin
","
who
was
to
be
seeded
11th
","
is
still
suffering
from
tendinitis
of
the
right
wrist
that
has
kept
her
sidelined
in
recent
months
.
Rubin
's
misfortune
turned
into
a
very
lucky
break
for
eighth-seeded
Olympic
champion
Lindsay
Davenport
.
Davenport
had
drawn
one
of
the
toughest
first-round
assignments
of
any
of
the
seeded
players
in
17th-ranked
Karina
Habsudova
of
Slovakia
.
But
as
the
highest-ranked
non-seeded
player
in
the
tournament
","
Habsudova
will
be
moved
into
Rubin
's
slot
in
the
draw
","
while
Davenport
will
now
get
a
qualifier
in
the
first
round
","
according
to
U.S.
Tennis
Association
officials
.
Rubin
is
the
third
notable
withdrawal
from
the
women
's
competition
after
12th-ranked
former
Australian

champion
Mary
Pierce
and

Albanian
Socialists
start
landmark
reform
congress
.
TIRANA
1996-08-24
Albania
's
opposition
Socialist
Party
began
a
two-day
congress
on
Saturday
to
discuss
major
jettisoning
its
links
with
almost
half
a
century
of
Stalinist
dictatorship
in
the
Balkan
country
.
The
congress
will
approve
new
concepts
that
will
turn
the
party
into
a
Social-Democratic
and
electoral
party
","
not
a
class
and
ideological
one
","
the
Socialist
Zeri
i
Popullit
daily
said
in
an
editorial
.
Jailed
Socialist
leader
Fatos
Nano
made
the
first
call
for
change
in
July
","
a
month
after
the
party
's
chief
opponents
","
the
conservative
Democrats
of
President
Sali
Berisha
","
almost
swept
the
board
in
a
disputed
general
election
.
The
Socialists
","
reformed
heirs
to
the
communists
","
pulled
out
of
the
poll
saying
it
was
a
sham
.
Acting
Socialist
leader
Servet
Pellumbi
has
said
he
too
will
urge
the
party
to
scrap
the
ideas
of
Karl
Marx
at
the
congress
.
The
pro-reform
stance
of
some
of
the
party
leadership
initially
caused
a
storm
and
triggered
the
resignation
last
month
of
the
party
's
Secretary-General
Gramoz
Ruci
.
More
recently
political
commentators
have
reported
a
growing
consensus
","
however
","
and
a
rift
at
the
meeting
looks
increasingly
unlikely

-
paper
.
JERUSALEM
1996-08-25
Israeli
President
Ezer
Weizman
has
invited
Yasser
Arafat
to
meet
him
at
his
private
home
","
Israel
's
biggest
newspaper
said
on
Sunday
.
The
Yedioth
Ahronoth
daily
reported
that
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
","
who
has
said
he
has
no
desire
to
hold
talks
with
the
Palestinian
president
","
opposes
the
meeting
due
to
be
held
this
coming
week
.
The
newspaper
said
Weizman
scheduled
the
meeting
at
his
private
residence
in
the
central
Israeli
village
of
Caesarea
after
Arafat
sent
him
an
emotional
appeal
to
save
the
peace
process
.
Netanyahu
met
Weizman
last
Tuesday
and
voiced
his
opposition
","
Yedioth
said
.
I
am
prepared
to
postpone
the
meeting
under
one
condition
--
that
you
give
me
a
commitment
right
now
to
meet
Arafat
yourself
within
10
days
","
the
paper
quoted
Weizman
as
telling
Netanyahu
.
It
said
Netanyahu
had
yet
to
give
Weizman
an
answer
.
The
office
of
Israeli
president
is
largely
ceremonial
.
But
Weizman
","
a
former
defence
minister
and
an
architect
of
Israel
's
peace
treaty
with
Egypt
","
has
spoken
out
frequently
on
the
peace
process
with
the
Palestinians

at
times
urging
the
former
Labour
government
to
slow
it

The

extradite

men

but
Sudan
says
it
cannot
hand
them
over
to
Ethiopia

trial
because
they
are
not

We
are
still
eager
that
nothing

we
will
not
