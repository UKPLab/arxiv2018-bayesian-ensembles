South

yet

from
apartheid
enforcers
.
Anton

CAPE
TOWN
1996-08-25
South
Africa
's
truth
commission
begins
issuing
subpoenas
this
week
in
a
bid
to
dig
beneath
the
political
rationales
and
find
the
sinister
figures
who
have
the
blood
of
the
country
's
race
war
on
their
hands
.
Leaders
of
the
major
parties
involved
","
from
right-wing
whites
to
radical
blacks
","
appeared
before
Archbishop
Desmond
Tutu
's
Truth
and
Reconciliation
Commission
last
week
to
paint
the
broad
picture
of
their
actions
for
or
against
apartheid
.
Most
","
including
former
president
F.W.
de
Klerk
and
African
National
Congress
Deputy
President
Thabo
Mbeki
","
offered
apologies
for
any
mistakes
they
had
made
and
accepted
broad
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
their
foot
soldiers
.
But
none
named
those
guilty
of
ordering
or
carrying
out
any
of
the
gross
violations
of
human
rights
which
Tutu
is
investigating
.
Human
rights
lawyer
Brian
Currin
said
the
hearings
last
week
were
not
intended
as
a
form
of
confessional
and
that
those
who
personally
committed
crimes
during
apartheid
would
testify
only
before
a
separate
arm
of
the
commission
","
the
amnesty
committee
.
I
do
n't
think
one
should
have
expected
more
than
what
one
got
","
he
said
.
That
was
not
the
amnesty
committee
where
perpetrators
are
expected
to
open
their
hearts
and
souls
and
to
tell
it
all
.
The
commission
","
which
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesty
to
those
who
confess
to
abuses
","
has
begun
hearing
the
testimony
from
people
already
in
jail
for
their
deeds
.
But
others
","
such
as
self-confessed
secret
police
hit-squad
leader
Dirk
Coetzee
","
have
yet
to
testify
.
Tutu
's
deputy
chairman
","
Alex
Boraine
","
told
reporters
the
commission
would
begin
issuing
subpoenas
to
suspects
who
refused
to
appear
voluntarily
some
time
this
week
.
He
added
that
former
hardline
apartheid
president
P.W.
Botha
could
be
among
those
called
.
But
Currin
","
who
is
advising
several
people
regarded
as
perpetrators
","
said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
commission
's
aims
.
A
person
can
be
forced
to
appear
","
but
the
only
way
one
is
going
to
get
to
the
truth
in
its
totality
is
if
people
feel
it
is
a
good
idea
to
go
to
the
amnesty
committee
.
At
the
moment
this
is
not
the
case
.
He
cited
Coetzee
","
who
was
charged
with
murder
after
confessing
in
media
interviews
to
dirty
tricks
.
His
trial
is
due
to
start
in
December
but
the
truth
commission
intends
to
decide
on
his
amnesty
application
before
that
.
Currin
said
the
law
had
to
be
changed
so
all
judicial
prosecutions
were
automatically
suspended
for
those
who
approached
the
truth
commission
.
Last
week
's
submissions
to
the
commission
by
the
ANC
","
de
Klerk
's
National
Party
and
the
right-wing
Freedom
Front
of
General
Constand
Viljoen
left
many
South
Africans
unsatisfied
.
Boraine
said
the
picture
was
incomplete
because
officers
of
the
apartheid-era
security
forces
had
yet
to
make
their
scheduled
","
separate
submission
","
but
one
black
caller
to
a
radio
talk
show
declared
:
This
whole
thing
is
utterly
useless
","
it
does
n't
help
us
at
all
.
What
the
people
expect
is
to
have
houses
","
to
have
jobs
.
Political
scientist
Jannie
Gagiano
said
he
doubted
that
the
National
Party
","
which
implemented
apartheid
in
1948
and
began
dismantling
it
in
1990
","
felt
it
carried
a
burden
of
guilt
and
needed
to
be
exculpated
through
the
commission
.
Therefore
I
have
some
doubts
about
achieving
some
form
of
reconciliation
.
One
has
to
feel
a
bit
guilty
to
feel
the
need
for
reconciling
yourself
to
a
historical
adversary
","
he
said
.
Professor
Tom
Lodge
of
the
University
of
the
Witwatersrand
demurred
","
saying
:
In
the
irritation
","
in
the
jokes
","
in
the
anger
that
white
South
Africans
express
about
the
commission
","
I
think
there
's
a
moral
uneasiness
","
and
I
think
that
's
healthy
.
Responsibility
is
percolating
downwards

CAIRO
1996-08-22
The
chairman
of
national
carrier
EgyptAir
on
Thursday
blamed
the
control
tower
at
Istanbul
airport
for
the
EgyptAir
plane
accident
.
Twenty
people
were
injured
on
Wednesday
when
the
EgyptAir
Boeing
707
overshot
the
runway
","
caught
fire
","
hit
a
taxi
and
skipped
across
a
road
onto
a
railway
line
.
Chairman
Mohamed
Fahim
Rayyan
told
a
news
conference
at
Cairo
airport
:
The
control
tower
should
have
allocated
the
plane
another
runway
","
instead
of
the
one
the
plane
landed
on
.
The
one
it
landed
on
is
"2,250"
metres
(
"2,460"
yards
)
long
while
the
other
one
if
more
than
"3,000"
metres
(
"3,300"
yards
)
long
and
is
less
steep
","
he
added
.
He
said
a
Turkish
civil
aviation
authority
official
had
made
the
same
point
and
he
noted
that
a
Turkish
plane
had
a
similar
accident
there
in
1994
.
The
EgyptAir
pilot
blamed
Turkish
airport
staff
for
misleading
him
.
The
landing
took
place
after
a
rainstorm
.
Its
not
an
accident
.
It
's
very
wet
.
The
brake
action
is
very
poor
and
the
tower
said
it
's
medium
.
That
's
wrong
","

pilot
told

So

","
where

have
played
golf
with
the
Irish
Foreign

Dick
Spring
","

them
the

they
waved
when
Clinton
addressed
Ireland
at
a
packed
ceremony
in
Dublin
city
centre
on
December
1
","
last
year
.
They
read
:

Clinton
.
The
Democratic
party
have
requested
we
bring
our
placards
with
us
.
We
will
be

said
Frank
Quilter
","
one
of

Clinton
made
a
triumphant
Irish
tour
to
back
a
Northern
Ireland

was
forced
to
drop
Ballybunion
from
a
packed

at
the

Revered
skull

Scottish
woman
's
.
JOHANNESBURG
1996-08-24
A
limelight-loving
South
African
chief
was
in
disgrace
on
Saturday
after
a
prized
skull
he
brought
home
from
Scotland
was
identified
as
belonging
not
to
his
sacred
tribal
ancestor
","
but
to
a
middle-aged
white
woman
.
A
forensic
scientist
who
examined
the
supposed
skull
of
19th
century
King
Hintsa
","
a
chief
of
President
Nelson
Mandela
's
Xhosa
tribe
killed
in
battle
by
the
British
","
said
it
was
in
fact
the
cranium
of
a
European
woman
.
Chief
Nicholas
Gcaleka
","
dressed
in
animal
skins
and
full
tribal
regalia
","
journeyed
to
a
wintry
Scotland
in
February
on
a
hugely
publicised
quest
to
find
Hintsa
's
skull
.
The
witchdoctor
said
ancestors
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
ordered
him
to
return
the
head
","
said
to
have
been
carried
off
as
a
colonial
trophy
by
the
officer
who
shot
and
allegedly
beheaded
Hintsa
after
a
battle
in
1835
.
But
Gcaleka
ran
into
trouble
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
South
Africa
with
a
skull
he
found
in
a
cottage
in
a
lonely
Highland
forest
near
Inverness
.
He
said
the
spirit
of
a
hurricane
had
guided
him
there
.
Members
of
the
Xhosa
royal
family
","
branding
Gcaleka
a
charlatan
","
confiscated
the
head
and
sent
it
for
tests
to
a
forensic
scientist
","
who
examined
the
shape
of
the
skull
and
the
hole
that
he
determined
had
not
come
","
as
supposed
","
from
a
bullet
.
It
can
be
stated
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
this
skull
is
not
that
of
the
late
king
","
the
scientist
said
in

statement

The
Zimbabwean
government
fired
thousands
of
workers
on
Saturday
for
defying
an
order
to
end
a
strike
which
has
crippled
essential
services
and
disrupted
international

The
Public

that
the
workers
--

other
people
to
replace
the
strikers
","
sub-contracting
some
of

work

The
government
had
been
threatening
to
fire
the
workers
since
the
strike
began
on
Tuesday
","
saying
it
was
illegal
.
But
the
strikers
ignored
the
threat

vowed
to
stay
on
the
streets
until
their
demands
for
wage
rises
of
30
to
60
percent
were
met
.
The
stoppage
has
left

services
stretched

The
worst
period

when
we
were
beaten
with
Kalashnikovs

he

For
the
first
period
we
were
held
in

bombarded
regularly

During

the
fighting
in

close

Clinton
campaign
busy
making
news
.
Laurence
McQuillan
WASHINGTON
1996-08-24
President
Bill
Clinton
has
served
notice
he
intends
to
be
busy
making
news
--
or
at
least
doing
things
that
look
and
sound
like
it
in
a
campaign
year
.
With
Democrats
gathering
in
Chicago
to
start
a
convention
on
Monday
to
nominate
him
for
a
second
term
as
president
","
Clinton
plans
a
steady
parade
of
events
designed
to
highlight
his
leadership
and
dim
the
glow
of
the
just-concluded
Republican
conclave
that
gave
a
boost
to
rival
Bob
Dole
.
After
a
week
of
carefully
orchestrated
events
signing
into
law
bills
passed
by
the
Republican-controlled
Congress
","
Clinton
used
his
Saturday
radio
address
to
the
nation
to
proudly
announce
a
development
in
the
war
on
crime
.
Sixty
days
ago
I
directed
the
attorney
general
to
draw
up
a
plan
for
a
national
registry
of
sex
offenders
","
Clinton
said
.
That
plan
has
now
reached
my
desk
.
Today
I
am
pleased
to
announce
that
we
are
following
through
on
our
commitment
to
keep
track
of
these
criminals
","
not
just
in
a
single
state
but
wherever
they
go
","
he
said
.
Actually
","
creation
of
such
a
registry
was
underway
without
Clinton
lifting
a
finger
.
Attorney
General
Janet
Reno
's
report
--
all
nine
pages
of
it
","
including
footnotes
--
offers
only
the
interim
services
of
the
FBI
until
a
formal
registry
on
sex
offenders
has
been
established
.
Two
months
ago
","
Clinton
announced
he
wanted
an
interim
effort
established
.
Now
","
60
days
later
","
he
had
a
chance
to
talk
about
it
again
.
It
is
an
example
of
Clinton
's
strategic
planning
as
he
heads
into
the
stretch
drive
for
the
Nov.
5
presidential
election
.
Such
things
do
not
happen
by
chance
in
the
Clinton
White
House
","
they
are
part
of
his
political
chess
game
.
In
the
past
week
Clinton
signed
into
law
an
increase
in
the
minimium
wage
","
a
bill
that
makes
it
easier
for
someone
with
a
pre-existing
health
problem
to
change
jobs
","
and
sweeping
changes
overhauling
the
nation
's
welfare
system
.
America
can
look
back
on
a
week
of
remarkable
achievement
","
Clinton
said
","
without
even
a
passing
reference
to
the
Republican
majority
in
the
House
and
Senate
.
America
is
on
the
right
track
offering
more
opportunity
","
demanding
more
responsibility
","
building
a
stronger
community
","
the
sense
of
shared
values
and
stronger
families
","
he
said
in
striking
the
theme
of
his
coming
week
.
According
to
a
senior
campaign
official
","
Clinton
will
be
making
a
lot
of
news
in
the
coming
week
--
something
different
each
day
.
Clinton
departs
on
Sunday
on
a
four-day
train
trip
through
West
Virginia
","
Kentucky
","
Ohio
","
Michigan
and
Indiana
while
fellow
Democrats
are
gathered
in
Chicago
.
He
'll
make
news
during
the
day
...
and
then
at
night
the
attention
will
go
to
the
convention
","
said
the
campaign
official
.
We
think
it
'll
work
really
well
.
Although
officials
decline
to
say
just
what
each
day
's
news
will
be
","
the
intent
is
to
put
a
focus
on
Clinton
himself
and
not
just
those
attending
the
party
's
convention
.
Each
day
of
the
trip
will
have
a
late
start
","
so
that
network
television
correspondents
will
be
able
to
do
live
reports
for
morning
programmes
.
Campaign
officials
then
hope
the
day
's
news
event
will
be
showcased
on
evening
television
news
shows
as
a
lead-in
for
that
night
's
convention
programme
.
We
'll
be
concentrating
...
on
supporting
the
president
as
he
is
on
the
trip
and
making
significant
public
policy
statements
related
to
some
of
his
plans
for
the
future
","
said
White
House
Press
Secretary
Mike
McCurry
.
McCurry
said
that
when
Clinton
delivers
his
acceptance
address
on
Thursday
night
to
fellow
Democrats
and
a
national
television
audience
","
he
will
set
out
a
road
map
for
the
nation
's
future
--
one
the
president
hopes
guides
him
back
to
the
White
House
for
four
more
years

million

Thursday
as
three
Aussies
reached
the
quarter-finals
with

three-hour
evening

and
O'Brien
beat
Mikael
Tillstrom
of
Sweden
6-3

.
If
you
really
look
at
the
match
","
said
the
12th-ranked
Washington
after
losing
to
the
70th-ranked
Rafter
","
I
never
really
got
a
chance
to
play
because
he
was
serving
big
and
getting
in
close
to
the
net
.
He
was
also
able
to
handle
my
serve
pretty
easily
because
my
(
first
)
service
percentage
was
only
in
the
40s
.
Put
those
two
things
together
and
you
get
a
loss
.
Rafter
missed
10
weeks
after
wrist
surgery
earlier
this
year
and
the
time
away
from
tennis
has
given
him
a
new
perspective
.
Before
when
I
was
on
tour
","
I
always
felt
I
had
to
be
in
bed
by
9:30
or
10
o'clock
and
I
had
to
be
up
at
a
certain
time
","
Rafter
said
.
Now
I
can
go
to
bed
at
at
midnight
or
wake
up
at
seven
in
the
morning
.
I
just
do
n't
have
as
many
set
routines
and
it
's
made
me
a
happier
person
.
Martin
was
pleased
with
his
victory
over
Pioline
","
his
first
in
five
meetings
with
the
11th-ranked
Frenchman
.
It
's
always
difficult
to
win
a
match
when
you
lose
the
first
set
","
especially
against
someone
you
have
never
beaten
","
he
said
.
I
got
more
aggressive
in
the
second
and
third
sets
and
the
wind
picked
up
and
that
also
affected
things
because
Cedric
definitely
went
off
a
little
bit
.
The
26-year-old
O'Brien
","
who
won
the
ATP
Tour
stop
in
New
Haven
last
week
","
has
now
won
18
of
his
last
20
matches
","
dating
back
to
qualifying
rounds
in
Los
Angeles
in
late
July
.
He
ranks
76th
after
being
285th
four
weeks
ago
.
I
feel
I
'm
hitting
the
ball
well
even
though
I
'm
having
more
mental
letdowns
than
I
did
last
week
","
O'Brien
said
.
But
I
'm
still
competing
well
.
I
got
a
lot
of
first
serves
in
","
said
Enqvist
about
his
victory
over
Korda
.
I
did
n't
miss
that
many
shots
and
he
was
making
the
mistakes
.
Still
marvelling
at
an
exciting
64-stroke
rally
he
won
in
the
last
game
of
his
second-round
match
against
Javier
Sanchez
of
Spain
on
Tuesday
","
Enqvist
joked
","
Today
against
Petr
there
were
about
64
strokes
in
the
whole
match
.
It
was
mostly
short

U.S.
says
still
committed
to
Cuba
migration
pacts
.
WASHINGTON
1996-08-22
The
United
States
said
on
Thursday
it
remained
committed
to
migration
accords
with
Cuba
and
would
continue
to
repatriate
intercepted
Cuban
migrants
who
attempted
to
enter
U.S.
territory
illegally
.
A
State
Department
statement
appeared
in
part
a
response
to
Cuban
complaints
that
Washington
was
jeopardising
the
accords
by
failing
to
return
some
of
the
Cubans
involved
in
recent
illegal
migration
incidents
.
The
United
States
reiterates
its
full
commitment
to
the
implementation
of
the
accords
signed
by
the
two
countries
in
1994
and
1995
","
said
the
statement
by
spokesman
Glyn
Davies
.
The
United
States
will
continue
to
return
Cuban
migrants
intercepted
at
sea
who
seek
to
enter
the
United
States
or
the
Guantanamo
Naval
Base
illegally
","
it
said
.
Washington
would
also
take
prompt
and
effective
law
enforcement
action
against
alien
smuggling
and
hijackings
from
Cuba
","
it
added
.
Davies
told
reporters
the
statement
would
be
distributed
in
the
Cuban
exile
community
in
Miami
to
remind
everyone
of
the
importance
of
abiding
by
the
accords
and
avoiding
dangerous
attempts
to
cross
the
straits
from
Cuba
to
Florida
.
Havana
's
complaints
centred
on
an
incident
in
which
a
boatload
of
emigrants
capsized
in
the
Florida
Straits
last
week
and
two
recent
aircraft
hijackings
from
Cuba
.
Sixteen
of
those
picked
up
from
the
boat
were
returned
to
Cuba
but
eight
were
taken
to
the
United
States
and
three
to
Guantanamo
Bay
","
a
U.S.
base
on
Cuba
","
until
they
emigrated
to
another
nation
.
The
most
recent
hijacking
","
last
Friday
","
involved
three
hijackers
and
the
pilot
of
a
small
aircraft
.
Davies
said
on
Tuesday
the
pilot
could
soon
return
to
Cuba
but
U.S.
authorities
planned
to
try
the
hijackers
.
In
an
incident
on
July
7
","
a
Cuban
interior
ministry
official
hijacked
a
commercial
plane
and
sought
aylum
at
Guantanamo
Bay
.
Davies
said
he
knew
of
no
plans
to
return
the
man
to
Cuba

but
forecast
that

Independence
Day
would
help
increase
profits
by
at
least
20
percent
in
1996
.
From

earnings
perspective
","
the
current
fiscal
year
has
begun
with
great
promise
due
to
the
hit
motion
picture
'
Independence

","
'
News

said
in

statement
announcing
its
results
for

year

It
said
moderating
paper
prices
and
solid
orders
for
advertising
at
its
Fox
Broadcasting
television
network
in
the
United
States
would
also
help
boost
profits
in
the
1996
year
.
A
budgeted
profit
increase
of
at
least
20
percent
for
the
full
year
currently
appears
very
attainable
","
News
Corp
said
.
The
bullish
comments
for
the
coming
year
soothed
analysts
and
most
shareholders
","
who
were
disappointed
by
the
lower
than
expected
profit
for
1995
.
News
announced
pre-abnormals
net
profit
for
the
year
fell
six
percent
to
A$
1.26
billion
(
US$
995

dropped

cents
from
46
cents
.
Analysts
had
on
average
expected
a
pre-abnormals
profit
of
A$
1.343
billion
.
The
year
just
gone
was
disappointing
","
but
the
outlook
for
the
current
year
looks
good
","
First
Pacific
media
analyst
Lachlan
Drummond
said
.
News
Corp
said
strong
performances
in
U.S.
television
and
British
newspapers
were
offset
by
lower
profits
from
News
Corp
's
magazine
and
publishing
divisions
and
further
hefty
losses
from
its
Asian
Star
TV
operations
.
Higher
newsprint
prices
hit
profits
hard
.
Throughout
the
group
","
higher
paper
prices
increased
costs
by
over
US$
300
million
","
it
said
.
News
Corp
said
British
newspaper
operating
profits
rose
10
percent
for
the
year
","
as
higher
cover
prices
at
The
Sun
and
The
Times
and
higher
advertising
volumes
offset
increased
newsprint
costs
.
Advertising
revenues
at
The
Times
grew
20
percent
.
Analysts
said
sharply
lower
earnings
from
News
Corp
's
book
publishing
division
and
its
U.S.
magazines
had
been
the
major
surprises
in
the
results
for
1995
.
News
Corp
said
revenue
gains
at
its
magazines
and
inserts
division
were
offset
by
higher
paper
prices
and
lower
sales
at
the
U.S.
TV
Guide
.
News
said
dramatically
lower
earnings
from
the
British
arm
of
its
Harper-Collins
publishing
division
more
than
offset
healthy
results
from
its
U.S.
operation
.
It
said
the
demise
of
the
Net
Book
Agreement
had
hurt
the
British
operations
","
and
weak
performances
from
the
San
Francisco
unit
of
Harper-Collins
had
not
helped
.
The
minimum
price
setting
expired
last
September
when
three
publishers
pulled
out
.
But
it
was
the
bullish
profit
forecast
for
1996
that
took
the
spotlight
in
the
market
","
with
some
analysts
saying
20
percent
may
even
be
an
understatement
.
If
they
're
saying
at
least
20
percent
","
then
their
internal
forecasts
are
probably
saying
25
or
30
percent

one
Sydney

declined
to
be

BAGHDAD
1996-08-22
An
Iranian
exile
group
based
in
Iraq
vowed
on
Thursday
to
extend
support
to
Iran
's
Kurdish
rebels
after
they
were
attacked
by
Iranian
troops
deep
inside
Iraq
last
month
.
A
Mujahideen
Khalq
statement
said
its
leader
Massoud
Rajavi
met
in
Baghdad
the
Secretary-General
of
the
Kurdistan
Democratic
Party
of
Iran
(
KDPI
)
Hassan
Rastegar
on
Wednesday
and
voiced
his
support
to
Iran
's
rebel
Kurds
.
Rajavi
emphasised
that
the
Iranian
Resistance
would
continue
to
stand
side
by
side
with
their
Kurdish
compatriots
and
the
resistance
movement
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
","
it
said
.
A
spokesman
for
the
group
said
the
meeting
signals
a
new
level
of
cooperation
between
Mujahideen
Khalq
and
the
Iranian
Kurdish
oppositions
.
Iran
heavily
bombarded
targets
in
northern
Iraq
in
July
in
pursuit
of
KDPI
guerrillas
based
in
Iraqi
Kurdish
areas
outside
the
control
of
the
government
in
Baghdad
.
Iraqi
Kurdish
areas
bordering
Iran
are
under
the
control
of
guerrillas
of
the
Iraqi
Kurdish
Patriotic
Union
of
Kurdistan
(
PUK
)
group
.
PUK
and
Iraq
's
Kurdistan
Democratic
Party
(
KDP
)
the
two
main
Iraqi
Kurdish
factions
","
have
had
northern
Iraq
under
their
control
since
Iraqi
forces
were
ousted
from
Kuwait
in
the
1991
Gulf
War
.
Clashes
between
the
two
parties
broke
out
at
the
weekend
in
the
most
serious
fighting
since
a
U.S.-sponsored
ceasefire
last
year
.
Mujahideen
Khalq
said
Iranian
troops
had
also
been
shelling
KDP
positions
in
Qasri
region
in
Suleimaniya
province
near
the
Iranian
border
over
the
last
two
days
.
It
said
about
100
Iraqi
Kurds
were
killed
or
wounded
in
the
attack
.
Both
Iran
and
Turkey
mount
air
and
land
strikes
at
targets
in
northern
Iraq
in
pursuit
of
their
own
Kurdish
rebels
.

in
a
goalless
draw
.
One
Taibe
supporter
required
hospital
treatment
for
cuts
and
bruises
after
a
stone
struck
his
head
as
he
was
driving
from
the
stadium

We
're
used

hearing
the

Death

the
Arabs

","
said
Sameh
Haj
Yihye
","
a
Taibe
resident
who
studies
at
Jerusalem
's
Hebrew
University
.
But
we
know
that
these
are
only
words
","
nobody
has
died
from
hearing
them
and
it
only
makes
us
support
our
team
more
vehemently
.
The
dusty
town
of
Taibe
lacks
the
amenities
of
Jewish
communities
and
many
Israeli
Arabs
have
long
complained
of
state
discrimination
.
There
are
no
parks
or
empty
areas
of
land
around
here
","
so
when
we
want
to
play
a
friendly
game
of
soccer
we
all
load
up
in
the
car
and
travel
to
Tel
Aviv
","
60
km
(
36

)
away
","
Sameh
Haj
Yihye
said
.
The
town
's
ramshackle
"2,500-seat"
ground
is
accessible
only
by
two
dirt
tracks
.
We
plan
to
build
a
"10,000-seat"
stadium
","
but
it
may
well
be
situated
elsewhere
","
said
club
chairman
Abdul
Rahman
Haj
Yihye
.
We
will
discuss
this
with
the
mayor
and
hopefully
a
new
or
refurbished
ground
will
be
completed
by
the
start
of
the
new
year
.
In
the
meantime
","
Taibe
will
play
all
their
heavily
policed
home
matches
at
the
Jewish
coastal
town
of
Netanya
.
We
are
Israelis
","
there
is
no
question
about
that
","
said
Karem
Haj
Yihye
","
a
hotel
waiter
.
We
do
n't
have
any
connection

he
said
","
pointing
to
the
West

We
do

We

MIAMI

The
U.S.
and
Colombian
governments
reached
an
agreement
that
will
allow
AMR
Corp
's
American
Airlines
to
operate
three
round-trip
flights
between
New
York
and
Bogota
","
the
Department
of
Transportation
said
Friday
.
Under
the
agreement
","
which
followed
talks
in
Miami
this
week
","
AMR
also
will
be
allowed
to
shift
up
to
four
of
the
weekly
flights
it
now
operates
between
Miami
and
Colombia
to
its
New
York
gateway
.
The
United
States
also
will
be
able
to
designate
one
new
all-cargo
carrier
for
service
between
the
two
nations
after
two

Colombia
was
permitted
to
add
a
single
additional
round-trip
flight
to
its
current
New

service
","
although

Administration

Safety
program

Colombia
would
be
allowed
to
add

turned
down
American
's
request
to
operate
flights
between

Corporate
America
taking
new
view
on
compensation
.
Anne
Murray
NEW
YORK
1996-08-23
Corporate
America
is
planning
major
changes
in
employee
compensation
in
the
next
few
years
","
according
to
a
recent
study
.
What
it
comes
down
to
is
this
:
If
you
're
highly
skilled
","
you
'll
benefit
nicely
.
But
if
you
're
not
and
cannot
contribute
to
your
employer
's
goals
","
you
'll
be
paid
less
.
The
survey
","
conducted
in
late
1995
and
the
early
part
of
this
year
by
management
consulting
firm
Towers
Perrin
","
showed
that
the
focus
will
be
on
an
employee
's
overall
value
to
the
company
's
bottom
line
--
rather
than
how
well
an
employee
performs
a
specific
task
.
Presently
","
for
example
","
if
an
accountant
's
job
involves
doing
five
specific
tasks
","
he
or
she
can
expect
a
certain
salary
","
said
Sandra
O'Neal
","
a
Towers
Perrin
principal
.
In
the
future
","
the
accountant
will
be
evaluated
solely
on
knowledge
","
skill
and
abilities
","
she
said
.
In
addition
to
using
accounting
skills
","
the
accountant
will
also
have
to
be
creative
","
work
well
in
a
team
","
be
sensitive
to
customer
needs
and
set
productivity
goals
.
The
good
news
is
","
if
you
're
highly
skilled
and
have
many
abilities
","
you
'll
be
paid
more
","
said
O'Neal
.
The
bad
news
is
","
if
you
're
not
skilled
and
ca
n't
contribute
to
a
team
","
to
customer
service
and
the
organisation
's
goals
","
you
'll
be
paid
less
.
Of
the
750
mid-to-large
size
corporations
surveyed
","
81
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
","
and
more
than
two-thirds
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
.
Next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
","
and
78
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
","
skills-based
plan
for
both
management
and
non-management
employees
.
This
coming
shift
","
O'Neal
said
","
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
.
It
's
an
inexorable
change
.
After
World
War
II
","
corporations
adopted
a
military
model
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
","
she
said
.
But
as
the
economy
became
global
","
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
.
Multi-layers
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
","
O'Neal
said
.
Now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
.
O'Neal
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
.
If
your
team
does
well
","
you
'll
do
well
.
If
it
does
n't
do
well
","
do
n't
expect
a
raise
.
Is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
n't
keep
up
?
That
's
an
important
question
we
used
to
ask
a
lot
","
said
O'Neal
.
It
's
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
.
The
more
important
question
is
--
'
Do
we
have
results
?
'
To
get
those
results
","
27
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
","
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
.
Companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do
well
","
O'Neal
said
.
For
example
","
the
survey
rated
some
participants
in
the
survey
as
high-performing
companies
","
based
on
their
return
on
equity
above
16
percent
.
Those
companies
also
said
they
already
offer
employees
variable
pay
and
business
education
","
give
their
managers
more
control
over
pay
decisions
and
celebrate
employee
and
team
success
.
They
respect
employees
more
","
they
trust
employees
more
and
they
value
their
employees
more
","
O'Neal
said
.
The
key
to
success
at
high-performance
companies
is
engaging
employees
in
a
business
partnership
.
It
will
improve
a
company
's
bottom
line
.

Gencor
swells
profit
despite
setbacks
.
Melanie
Cheary
JOHANNESBURG
1996-08-26
Gencor
Ltd
on
Monday
said
it
had
swelled
its
year
attributable
profit
and
streamlined
operations
to
strengthen
it
for
the
current
financial
year
despite
a
variety
of
divisional
setbacks
.
Announcing
the
group
's
results
for
the
year
ended
June
30
","
chairman
Brian
Gilbertson
said
:
Happily
the
strong
improvement
in
financial
performance
is
not
an
illusion
arising
from
the
recent
weakness
of
the
rand
relative
to
the
dollar
.
Gencor
raised
attributable
earnings
to
"1,803"
million
rand
from
"1,003"
million
rand
previously
-
in
dollar
terms
an
increase
to
$
469
million
from
$
279
million
-
and
won
despite
the
group
's
Impala
Platinum
Holdings
Ltd
posting
dismal
results
.
Not
everything
has
gone
well
.
We
've
had
substantial
production
difficulties
at
a
number
of
our
operations
.
The
most
obvious
one
with
the
greatest
effect
on
the
corporation
was
at
Impala
where
we
had
the
furnace
failure
","
Gilbertson
said
.
Implats
posted
year
attributable
profit
of
176
million
rand
from
281
million
previously
.
Not
only
did
the
company
lock
in
3.92
rand
per
dollar
in
February
March
","
but
it
suffered
output
losses
due
to
a
furnace
shutdown
last
August
.
The
rand
was
last
bid
at
4.5350
against
the
dollar
.
Nor
was
Implats
the
only
operation
to
fail
output
targets
.
Ingwe
Coal
Corporation
Ltd
was
hit
hard
by
heavy
rains
.
It
forfeited
nearly
one
million
tonnes
of
production
to
flooding
at
its
mines
in
Mpumulanga
province
.
But
Gilbertson
said
the
greatest
gloom
in
the
year
came
from
the
European
Commission
's
blocking
of
Implats
'
proposed
merger
with
Lonrho
Plc
's
platinum
interests
.
The
big
disappointment
for
the
year
was
the
failure
of
the
platinum
merger
.
From
Gencor
's
perspective
we
are
taking
the
position
that
it
is
not
on
","
Gilbertson
said
.
Looking
ahead
to
the
current
financial
year
","
he
said
that
Gencor
would
boost
earnings
further
.
Gencor
is
well
placed
to
take
up
the
challenges
of
the
future
.
The
group
is
soundly
structured
and
prudently
financed
and
is
blessed
with
an
excellent
portfolio
of
world-class
businesses
.
I
think
we
can
look
forward
to
further
growth
.
Citing
the
disposal
of
Gencor
's
stake
in
industrial
holdings
group
Malbak
Ltd
for
one
billion
rand
among
other
smaller
disposals
","
Gilbertson
said
Gencor
had
pruned
its
portfolio
to
concentrate
on
core
assets
.
We
've
tried
to
clean
up
our
overall
portfolio
by
disposing
of
non-core
assets
.
The
biggest
of
those
was
Malbak
.
Overall
a
very
substantial
pruning
...
leaving
Gencor
clearly
structured
along
commodity
lines
","
Gilbertson
said
.
He
added
that
the
group
still
had
about
85
million
rand
after
tax
invested
in
various
shares
","
which
were
market
for
disposal
when
required
.
Referring
to
Gencor
's
increased
41.5
percent
stake
in
Ingwe
","
Gilbertson
said
the
group
would
wait
for
coal
shares
to
be
cheaper
before
considering
snapping
up
more
.
I
think
we
would
have
liked
to
have
more
of
Ingwe
but
it
's
the
question
of
adding
value
.
When
we
bought
the
shares
we
bought
...
at
quite
a
bit
lower
than
the
price
is
now
...
maybe
if
we
just
wait
another
few
years
for
the
next
downturn
in
coal
.
Finally
","
Gilbertson
said
a
growing
proportion
of
Gencor
's
income
was
coming
from
offshore
and
unlisted
investments
.

EU
rejects
German
call
to
boycott
British
lamb
.
Peter

BRUSSELS
1996-08-22
The
European
Commission
said
on
Thursday
it
disagreed
with
German
advice
to
consumers
to
shun
British
lamb
until
scientists
determine
whether
mad
cow
disease
can
be
transmitted
to
sheep
.
Germany
's
representative
to
the
European
Union
's
veterinary
committee
Werner
Zwingmann
said
on
Wednesday
consumers
should
buy
sheepmeat
from
countries
other
than
Britain
until
the
scientific
advice
was
clearer
.
We
do
n't
support
any
such
recommendation
because
we
do
n't
see
any
grounds
for
it
","
the
Commission
's
chief
spokesman
Nikolaus
van
der
Pas
told
a
news
briefing
.
He
said
further
scientific
study
was
required
and
if
it
was
found
that
action
was
needed
it
should
be
taken
by
the
European
Union
.
He
said
a
proposal
last
month
by
EU
Farm
Commissioner
Franz
Fischler
to
ban
sheep
brains
","
spleens
and
spinal
cords
from
the
human
and
animal
food
chains
was
a
highly
specific
and
precautionary
move
to
protect
human
health
.
Fischler
proposed
EU-wide
measures
after
reports
from
Britain
and
France
that
under
laboratory
conditions
sheep
could
contract
Bovine
Spongiform
Encephalopathy
(
BSE
)
--
mad
cow
disease
.
But
Fischler
agreed
to
review
his
proposal
after
the
EU
's
standing
veterinary
committee
","
mational
animal
health
officials
","
questioned
if
such
action
was
justified
as
there
was
only
a
slight
risk
to
human
health
.
Spanish
Farm
Minister
Loyola
de
Palacio
had
earlier
accused
Fischler
at
an
EU
farm
ministers
'
meeting
of
causing
unjustified
alarm
through
dangerous
generalisation
.
.
Only
France
and
Britain
backed
Fischler
's
proposal
.
The
EU
's
scientific
veterinary
and
multidisciplinary
committees
are
due
to
re-examine
the
issue
early
next
month
and
make
recommendations
to
the
senior
veterinary
officials
.
Sheep
have
long
been
known
to
contract
scrapie
","
a
brain-wasting
disease
similar
to
BSE
which
is
believed
to
have
been
transferred
to
cattle
through
feed
containing
animal
waste
.
British
farmers
denied
on
Thursday
there
was
any
danger
to
human
health
from
their
sheep
","
but
expressed
concern
that
German
government
advice
to
consumers
to
avoid
British
lamb
might
influence
consumers
across
Europe
.
What
we
have
to
be
extremely
careful
of
is
how
other
countries
are
going
to
take
Germany
's
lead

German
troops
to
remain
in

for

.
BONN
1996-08-24
Defence
Minister
Volker
Ruehe
said
that
German
troops
would
stay
on
in
Bosnia
next
year
as
part
of
an
international
force
to
ensure
the
establishment
of
peace
","
a
newspaper
reported
on
Saturday
.
The
current
NATO-led
peace
force
(
IFOR
)
in
Bosnia
is
due
to
return
home
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
But
Ruehe
told
Bild
am
Sonntag
in
an
interview
that
a
new
and
different
mandate
for
the
troops
would
be
agreed
on
for
next
year
after
the
current
mandate
expires
in
December
.
After
the
(
Bosnian
)
elections
(
on
September
14
)
the
troops
will
start
being
reduced
from
the
beginning
of
October
from
"60,000"
to
about
"20,000"
.
A
completely
new
and
different
mandate
will
be
agreed
for
next
year
","
Ruehe
said
.
The
defence
ministers
will
begin
negotiations
for
this
at
the
beginning
of
September
at
a
NATO
meeting
","
he
told
the
newspaper
in
an
interview
","
excerpts
of
which
were
released
ahead
of
publication
on
Sunday
.
But
we
must
avoid
giving
the
impression
this
peace
deployment
in
former
Yugoslavia
is
being
perceived
in
the
long
run
as
an
occupation
.
On
the
other
hand
we
must
prevent
any
return
of
war
and
massacres

on
Friday
that
relations
between
the
two
teams
had
healed
since
the
Sri
Lankans
'
acrimonious
tour
last
year
.
The
Sri
Lankans
were
first
found
guilty
then
cleared
of
ball
tampering
and
off-spinner
Muttiah
Muralitharan
was
called
for
throwing
during
a
controversial
three-test
series
in
Australia
.
Our
concern
is
to
get
out
there
and
play
proper
cricket
","
Sri

captain
Arjuna
Ranatunga

a

on
the
eve
of

said
he
agreed
with
Ranatunga
.
I
believe
relations
between
the
two
teams
will
be
excellent

.
The
Australians
are
making
their
first
visit
to
the
Indian
Ocean
island
since
boycotting
a
World
Cup
fixture
in
February
after
a
terrorist
bomb

Australia
have
been
promised
the
presence
of
commandos
","
sniffer
dogs
and
plainclothes
policemen
to
ensure
a
limited
overs
tournament
is
trouble-free
.
The
tournament
","
starting
on
August
26
","
also
includes
India
and
Zimbabwe
.
Battersby
said
he
was
satisfied
with
the
security
arrangements

said
they
expected
heavy
rain

washed
out
a
warmup

LONDON

A
British
photographer
branded
a
stalker
by
Princess
Diana
has
been
forced
to
postpone
a
legal
challenge
to
a
ban
on
approaching
her
because
he

criminal
damage

lawyer
said

started
a

as

was
preparing
to
contest
an
injunction
obtained
by
Diana
banning
him
from
coming
within
300
metres
(
yards
)
of
her
.
We
were
in
the
process

preparing

said
Stenning

Birnberg
told
Reuters
that
the
challenge
to
the
injunction
would
be
delayed
until
Stenning
was
released
.
Stenning
threw
a
brick

Iraq
retaliated
then
by
expelling
a

saying
it
was
committed
to
peace
and
wanted
to
open
negotiations
without
preconditions
.
But
it
slammed
Damascus
for
creating
what
it
called
a
dangerous
atmosphere
.
Syria
accused
Israel
on
Wednesday
of
launching
a
hysterical
campaign
against
it
after
Israeli
television
reported
that
Damascus
had
recently
test
fired
a
missile
.
It
said
its
arms
purchases
were
for
defensive
purposes
.
The
message
that
we
sent
to
(
Syrian
President
Hafez
al-
)
Assad
is
that
Israel
is
ready
at
any
time
without
preconditions
to
enter
peace
negotiations
","
Israeli
Foreign
Minister
David
Levy
told
Israel
Radio
in
an
interview
.
Tension
has
mounted
since
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
took
office
in
June
vowing
to
retain
the
Golan
Heights
Israel
captured
from
Syria
in
the
1967
Middle
East
war
.
Israeli-Syrian
peace
talks
have
been
deadlocked
over
the
Golan
since
1991
despite
the
previous
government
's
willingness
to
make
Golan
concessions
.
Peace
talks
between
the
two
sides
were
last
held
in
February
.
The
voices
coming
out
of
Damascus
are
bad
","
not
good
.
The
media
...
are
full
of
expressions
and
declarations
that
must
be
worrying
...
this
artificial
atmosphere
is
very
dangerous
because
those
who
spread
it
could
become
its
prisoners
","
Levy
said
.
We
expect
from
Syria
","
if
its
face
is
to
peace
","
that
it
will
answer
Israel
's
message
to
enter
peace
negotiations
because
that
is
our
goal
","
he
said
.
We
do
not
want
a
war
","
God
forbid
.
No
one
benefits
from
wars
.
Israel
's
Channel
Two
television
said
Damascus
had
sent
a
calming
signal
to
Israel
.
It
gave
no
source
for
the
report
.
Netanyahu
and
Levy
's
spokesmen
said
they
could
not
confirm
it
.
The

I

The
club
thought
it
(
the
job
)
had
run
its
course

I
came
to
the

conclusion
.

CHICAGO
1996-08-22
In
keeping
with
its
pioneering
image
in
the
area
of
welfare
","
Wisconsin
was
the
first
state
to
submit
an
administrative
plan
under
the
nation

law
","
Gov
.
Tommy
Thompson
said
Thursday
.
According
to
a
new
release
from
the
governor
","
Wisconsin
submitted
a
plan
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
for
administration
of
the
new
block
grant
system
for
welfare
just
minutes
after
President
Bill
Clinton
signed
the
measure
into
law
Thursday
.
As
the
nation
's
leader
in
welfare
reform
","
Wisconsin
is
far
ahead
of
the
curve
and
ready
to
go
under
this
new
system
","
Thompson
said
.
Still
","
the
governor
said
the
new
law
does
not
go
as
far
as
the
state
's
own
welfare
reform
program
","
dubbed
W-2
.
He
said
that
despite
the
new
law
","
Wisconsin

still
require
federal
waivers

A

Ministry
has
forced
him
to
sign
an
undertaking
not
to
distribute

by

They
made

He

ministry

made
him

this
a
few
weeks

he
brought
about
a
dozen
copies
from
Jordan
of
a

has
been
an
outspoken
critic
of
the
1993
Israeli-PLO
self-rule
deal
and
has
written
at
least
two
books
on
the
accord
.
On
Wednesday
a
bookseller
in
the
West

town

Ramallah
said
police
about
a
month

confiscated
several
copies
of
two
of
Said

Israel-PLO
self-rule
deals
.
Palestinian
Information
Ministry
Director-General
Mutawakel
Taha
denied
that
ministry
officials
forced
anyone
to
sign
any
undertaking
and
insisted
that
the
Palestinian
Authority
has
no
plans
to
censor
books
.
There
is
no
strategy
to
ban
books
or
to
suppress
freedom
of
expression
in
any
form
whatsoever
","
Taha
told
Reuters
.
But
Taha
said
that
the
absence
of
relevent
legislations
may
have
resulted
in
some
mistakes
by
some
security
officials
.
This
may
explain
some
mistakes
against
some
journalists

writers
","
he
said
.
Daoud
said
books
by
other
authors
","
including
British
Journalist
Patrick

","
were
also
banned
.
He
said
that
security
officials
often
visit
his
shop
to
make
sure
he
was
not
selling
the
books
.
I
think
this
is
a
bad
beginning

If
we
have
confidence

why
should
we
be
afraid

Daoud
said
.
Thousands
of
books
were
banned
from
sale
in
the
West

1996-08-25
Thousands
of
Moslem
refugees
denounced
Bosnia
's
elections
as
a
farce
on
Sunday
because
Serb
incomers
would
be
able
to
vote
in
their
old
home
town
","
cementing
partition
of
the
country
.
They
said
they
were
ready
to
force
their
way
back
across
post-war
ethnic
lines
to
Serb-held
Doboj
","
one
of
several
towns
where
NATO
troops
fear
violence
involving
refugees
determined
to
vote
where
they
once
lived
.
The
refugees
","
rallying
in
Matuzici
on
government
territory
two
km
from
Doboj
in
northeast
Bosnia
","
waved
banners
calling
the
polls
a
farce
staged
by
the
United
Nations
and
the
European
Union
.
We
demand
to
vote
in
Doboj
","
other
banners
said
.
Bosnia
's
Moslem-led
central
government
and
many
displaced
Moslems
are
angered
by
a
key
provision
of
the
Western-organised
September
14
elections
allowing
people
to
vote
in
post-war
new
places
of
residence
.
As
a
result
","
separatist
Serb
authorities
have
packed
former
Moslem
majority
towns
with
refugees
of
their
own
or
registered
other
Serbs
to
vote
there
.
Critics
say
that
what
was
billed
as
an
electoral
process
to
reintegrate
Bosnia
as
a
single
","
multi-ethnic
state
is
shaping
up
as
a
referendum
on
partition
","
de
facto
or
de
jure
.
Only
our
physical
presence
in
Doboj
will
mean
that
the
Dayton
peace
treaty
has
truly
been
implemented
","
Edhem
Efendija
Camdzic
","
Doboj
's
Islamic
imam-in-exile
","
told
the
refugees
.
The
main
point
of
this
rally
is
to
highlight
to
the
world
powers
what
misfortune
they
brought
upon
us
","
said
Reuf
Mehemdagic
","
head
of
Doboj
municipality-in-exile
.
Eleven
thousand
Serbs
who
came
from
elsewhere
to
Doboj
will
vote
there
.
How
can
we
then
expect
the
reintegration
of
Bosnia
?
But
no
one
will
stop
us
from
returning
to
our
homes
.
Mirhunisa
Komarica
","
a
government
refugee
official
","
said
:
We
want
to
vote
where
we
were
thrown
out
from
.
This
is
a
protest
of
warning
and
the
next
step
is
entering
our
town
using
all
means
possible
","
so
let
them
shoot
.
Bosnian
Vice
President
Ejup
Ganic
","
a
Moslem
","
told
the
refugees
:
We
have
a
message
for
the
Serbs
who
are
now
in
our
homes
not
to
plan
the
future
of
their
children
there
because
there
will
be
no
good
fortune
in
that
.
To
loud
applause
","
he
added
:
We
will
enter
Doboj
","
untie
the
Doboj
knot
and
ensure
free
movement
for
all
.
We
have
to
enter
Doboj
to
free
the
Serbs
from
their
own
(
separatist
)
politics
.
The
Dayton
peace
accords
guaranteed
refugees
the
right
to
return
to
their
homes
and
ensured
freedom
of
movement
across
ethnic
lines
.
But
local
police
","
controlled
by
nationalist
parties
in
Moslem
","
Serb
and
Croat
sectors
of
Bosnia
","
and
civilian
mobs
have
turned
ceasefire
lines
into
virtually
impassable
borders
.
The
majority
of
refugees
from
Bosnia
's
1992-95
war
are
Moslems
from
the
Serb-controlled
north
and
east
.
NATO-led
peace
troops
beefed
up
their
presence
in
the
Doboj
area
on
Sunday
to
deter
any
sudden
emotional
attempt
by
the
refugees
to
cross
the
Inter-Entity
Boundary
Line
into
Doboj
.
But
the
crowd
dispersed
without
incident
.
Moslems
and
Serbs
have
scuffled
several
times
along
the
line
in
the
past
when
Moslem
refugees
tried
to
surge
into
the
town
.

U.S.

have
trained
a
pair
of
sea
lions
to
tag
and
photograph
elusive
whales
as
they
cruise
through

James

their

Any

knows
that
when
a
whale

going
you
ca
n't
keep
up
","
Harvey
told
the
magazine
.
That
is
why
we
know
only
about
five
percent
of
what
whales
do
.
The
sea
lions
--
17-year-old
Beaver
and
nine-year-old
Sake
--
have
undergone
six
years
of
training
for
their
mission
.
Beaver
once
worked
for
the
U.S.
Navy
and
Sake
is
an
amusement
park
veteran

Harvey
said
they
could
accurately
tag

could

The

how
the

Russia

MOSCOW

Russian
officials
","
keen
to
cut

flight
","
will
adopt
tight
measures
to
cut
barter
deals
in
foreign
trade
to
a
minimum
","
a
customs
official
said
on
Friday
.
We
have
always
been
concerned
about
barter
deals
with
other
countries
","
viewing
them
as
a
disguised
kind
of
capital
flight
from
Russia
","
Marina
Volkova
","
deputy
head
of
the
currency
department
at
the
State
Customs
Committee
","
told
Reuters
.
Volkova
said
last
year
goods
had
been
exported
under
many
Russian
barter
deals
","
with
nothing
imported
in
return
.
She
said
the
cost
of
such
unimported
goods
was
$
1.10
billion
in
1995
.
Barter
deals
were
worth
$
4.9
billion
last
year
","
or
about
eight
percent
of
all
Russian
exports
estimated
at
$
61.5
billion
","
she
said
.
The
cost
of
exported
goods
is
too
often
understated
","
so
the
actual
share
of
barter
deals
in
Russian
exports
and
the
amount
of
unimported
goods
may
be
even
higher
","
Volkova
said
.
A
few
days
ago
Russian
President
Boris
Yeltsin
issued
a
decree
on
state
regulation
of
foreign
barter
deals
","
and
Volkova
said
this
could
substantially
improve
the
situation
.
In
line
with
the
decree
","
which
will
come
into
force
on
November
1
","
all
Russian
barter
traders
will
be
obliged
to
import
goods
worth
the
cost
of
their
exports
within
180
days
.
If
traders
are
late
","
they
will
have
to
pay
fines
worth
the
cost
of
their
exported
goods
","
Volkova
said
.
Understating
the
cost
of
exported
goods
could
still
be
a
loophole
for
barter
dealers
","
but
Volkova
said
the
authorities
are
currently
tackling
the
technicalities
of
the
issue
.
Barter
has
always
been
a
feature
of
the
Soviet
Union
's
foreign
trade
","
but
Yeltsin
's
decrees
liberalising
foreign
trade
in
1991-1992
has
given
barter
a
new
impetus
.
A
few
years
ago
","
barter
deals
accounted
for
up
to
25-30
percent
of
Russian
exports
because
thousands
(
of
)
trade
companies
which
popped
up
preferred
barter
in
the
absence
of
reliable
Russian
banks
and
money
transfer
systems
","
Volkova
said
.
Now
many
Russian
banks
are
strong
and
can
make
various
sorts
of
money
tranfers
","
while
incompetent
traders
are
being
ousted
by
more
experienced
ones
.
But
the
current
share
of
barter
deals
in
Russian
exports
is
still
high

BRUSSELS
1996-08-24
Belgian
police
searched
two
more
houses
on
Saturday
for
bodies
in
a
child-sex
scandal
of
murder
","
kidnapping
and
pornography
that
has
sent
a
shockwave
of
revulsion
throughout
Europe
.
Recriminations
built
up
over
how
the
scandal
's
central
figure
","
convicted
child
rapist
Marc
Dutroux
","
managed
to
prey
on
children
unhindered
for
so
long
.
In
just
over
a
week
two
young
girls
have
been
found
dead
","
from
starvation
","
two
have
been
freed
from
a
dungeon-like
secret
compartment
and
an
international
hunt
has
started
for
at
least
two
others
.
On
Saturday
investigators
with
dogs
trained
to
find
bodies
searched
one
house
at
Ransart
and
one
at
Mont-sur-Marchienne
--
both
suburbs
of
the
southern
city
of
Charleroi
.
Both
houses
are
owned
by
Dutroux
.
Belgian
media
speculated
that
Dutroux
","
charged
with
abduction
and
illegal
imprisonment
of
children
","
must
have
had
high
level
protection
to
molest
youngsters
.
They
put
forward
no
proof
to
support
the
speculation
","
but
seized
on
a
comment
by
chief
prosecutor
Michel
Bourlet
on
Belgian
television
on
Friday
night
that
he
would
chase
down
everyone
involved
in
the
case
if
I
am
allowed
to
.
Bourlet
said
between
300
and
400
paedophile
porn
video
tapes
had
been
seized
","
some
of
which
featured
Dutroux
.
Dutroux
was
charged
a
week
ago
after
police
rescued
two
young
girls
from
a
concrete
dungeon
in
the
basement
of
one
of
the
six
houses
he
owns
in
and
around
Charleroi
.
Just
a
day
later
the
national
euphoria
at
the
rescue
turned
to
disgust
as
Dutroux
led
police
to
the
bodies
of
two
eight-year-old
girls
in
another
of
his
houses
.
Julie
Lejeune
and
Melissa
Russo
","
had
been
kidnapped
in
June
last
year
.
Dutroux
said
they
starved
to
death
nine
months
later
.
He
also
admitted
kidnapping
two
other
girls
","
An
Marchal
and
Eefje
Lambrecks
","
a
year
ago
.
The
fate
of
the
girls
is
unknown
","
but
there
has
been
speculation
they
were
sold
into
prostitution
in
Slovakia
or
the
Czech
Republic
where
Dutroux
was
a
frequent
visitor
.
Belgian
police
have
visited
Bratislava
and
will
visit
Prague
.
Five
other
people
have
been
arrested
including
Dutroux
's
second
wife
Michelle
Martin
","
charged
as
an
accomplice
.
The
others
have
been
charged
with
abduction
and
illegal
imprisonment
of
children
or
are
suspected
of
criminal
association
.
Dutch
police
are
also
holding
a
74-year
old
Dutchman
in
connection
with
the
disappearance
of
An
and
Eefje
","
although
a
spokesman
said
no
direct
link
had
yet
been
established
.
At
least
part
of
the
speculation
in
the
Belgian
media
of
high-level
protection
for
Dutroux
and
his
accomplices
is
based
on
leaked
documents
cataloguing
a
high
degree
of
police
bungling
","
incompetence
and
indifference
.
Among
the
revelations
are
the
fact
that
the
gendarmerie
was
running
a
surveillance
operation
codenamed
Othello
against
Dutroux
in
1995
--
when
both
Julie
and
Melissa
and
An
and
Eefje
were
kidnapped
.
They
show
that
the
gendarmes
were
aware
that
Dutroux
was
building
cells
in
some
of
his
houses
for
holding
children
","
yet
this
information
was
either
not
passed
on
to
other
police
forces
searching
for
the
missing
girls
or
was
overlooked
when
it
was
.
They
also
show
that
police
investigating
a
theft
visited
Dutroux
late
last
year
at
the
house
where
Julie
and
Melissa
were
being
held
but
accepted
his
word
that
the
children
's
cries
they
could
hear
came
from
neighbours
.
Justice
Minister
Stefaan
De
Clerck
has
admitted
that
mistakes
were
made
and
ordered
an
inquiry
at
the
same
time
as
stressing
there
were
no
indications
of
a
cover-up
.
There
is
also
widespread
disbelief
that
no
one
appeared
to
question
how
Dutroux
","
an
unemployed
father
of
three
with
no
visible
means
of
support
","
managed
to
own
six
houses
