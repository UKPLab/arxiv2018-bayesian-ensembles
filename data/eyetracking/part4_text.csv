The
trial
of
John
Cavendish
for
the
murder
of
his
stepmother
took
place
two
months
later
Of
the
intervening
weeks
I
will
say
little
but
my
admiration
and
sympathy
went
out
to
Mary
Cavendish
She
ranged
herself
passionately
on
her
husband's
side
scorning
the
mere
idea
of
his
guilt
and
fought
for
him
tooth
and
nail
I
expressed
my
admiration
to
and
he
nodded
thoughtfully
Yes
she
is
of
those
women
who
show
at
their
best
in
adversity
It
brings
out
all
that
is
sweetest
and
truest
in
them
Her
pride
and
her
jealousy
have
Jealousy
I
queried
Yes
Have
you
not
realized
that
she
is
an
unusually
jealous
woman
As
I
was
saying
her
pride
and
jealousy
have
been
laid
aside
She
thinks
of
nothing
but
her
husband
and
the
terrible
fate
that
is
hanging
over
him
He
spoke
very
feelingly
and
I
looked
at
him
earnestly
remembering
that
last
afternoon
when
he
had
been
deliberating
whether
or
not
to
speak
With
his
tenderness
for
a
woman's
happiness
I
felt
glad
that
the
decision
had
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
Even
now
I
said
I
can
hardly
believe
it
You
see
up
to
the
very
last
minute
I
thought
it
was
Lawrence
grinned
I
know
you
did
But
John
My
old
friend
John
Every
murderer
is
probably
old
friend
observed
philosophically
You
cannot
mix
up
sentiment
and
reason
I
must
say
I
think
you
might
have
given
me
a
hint
Perhaps
mon
ami
I
did
not
do
so
just
because
he
was
your
old
friend
I
was
rather
disconcerted
by
this
remembering
how
I
had
busily
passed
on
to
John
what
I
believed
to
be
views
concerning
He
by
the
way
had
been
acquitted
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
Nevertheless
although
he
had
been
too
clever
for
them
this
time
and
the
charge
of
espionage
could
not
be
brought
home
to
him
his
wings
were
pretty
well
clipped
for
the
future
I
asked
whether
he
thought
John
would
be
condemned
To
my
intense
surprise
he
replied
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
extremely
likely
to
be
acquitted
But
I
protested
Oh
my
friend
have
I
not
said
to
you
all
along
that
I
have
no
proofs
It
is
one
thing
to
know
that
a
man
is
guilty
it
is
quite
another
matter
to
prove
him
so
And
in
this
case
there
is
terribly
little
evidence
That
is
the
whole
trouble
I
know
but
I
lack
the
last
link
in
my
chain
And
unless
I
can
find
that
missing
link
He
shook
his
head
gravely
When
did
you
first
suspect
John
Cavendish
I
asked
after
a
minute
or
two
Did
you
not
suspect
him
at
all
No
indeed
Not
after
that
fragment
of
conversation
you
overheard
between
Mrs
Cavendish
and
her
and
her
subsequent
lack
of
frankness
at
the
inquest
No
Did
you
not
put
two
and
two
together
and
reflect
that
if
it
was
not
Alfred
who
was
quarrelling
with
his
you
remember
he
strenuously
denied
it
at
the
must
be
either
Lawrence
or
John
Now
if
it
was
Lawrence
Mary
conduct
was
just
as
inexplicable
But
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
John
the
whole
thing
was
explained
quite
naturally
So
I
cried
a
light
breaking
in
upon
me
it
was
John
who
quarrelled
with
his
mother
that
afternoon
Exactly
And
you
have
known
this
all
along
Certainly
Mrs
behaviour
could
only
be
explained
that
way
And
yet
you
say
he
may
be
acquitted
shrugged
his
shoulders
Certainly
I
do
At
the
police
court
proceedings
we
shall
hear
the
case
for
the
prosecution
but
in
all
probability
his
solicitors
will
advise
him
to
reserve
his
defence
That
will
be
sprung
upon
us
at
the
trial
by
the
way
I
have
a
word
of
caution
to
give
you
my
friend
I
must
not
appear
in
the
case
What
No
Officially
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
Until
I
have
found
that
last
link
in
my
chain
I
must
remain
behind
the
scenes
Mrs
Cavendish
must
think
I
am
working
for
her
husband
not
against
him
I
say
that's
playing
it
a
bit
low
down
I
protested
Not
at
all
We
have
to
deal
with
a
most
clever
and
unscrupulous
man
and
we
must
use
any
means
in
our
he
will
slip
through
our
fingers
That
is
why
I
have
been
careful
to
remain
in
the
background
All
the
discoveries
have
been
made
by
and
will
take
all
the
credit
If
I
am
called
upon
to
give
evidence
at
smiled
will
probably
be
as
a
witness
for
the
defence
I
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
It
is
quite
en
continued
Strangely
enough
I
can
give
evidence
that
will
demolish
one
contention
of
the
prosecution
Which
one
The
one
that
relates
to
the
destruction
of
the
will
John
Cavendish
did
not
destroy
that
will
was
a
true
prophet
I
will
not
go
into
the
details
of
the
police
court
proceedings
as
it
involves
many
tiresome
repetitions
I
will
merely
state
that
John
Cavendish
reserved
his
defence
and
was
duly
committed
for
trial
September
found
us
all
in
London
Mary
took
a
house
in
Kensington
being
included
in
the
family
party
I
myself
had
been
given
a
job
at
the
War
Office
so
was
able
to
see
them
continually
As
the
weeks
went
by
the
state
of
nerves
grew
worse
and
worse
That
last
link
he
talked
about
was
still
lacking
Privately
I
hoped
it
might
remain
so
for
what
happiness
could
there
be
for
Mary
if
John
were
not
acquitted
On
September
John
Cavendish
appeared
in
the
dock
at
the
Old
Bailey
charged
with
The
Wilful
Murder
of
Emily
and
pleaded
Not
Guilty
Sir
Ernest
the
famous
K
C
had
been
engaged
to
defend
him
Mr
K
C
opened
the
case
for
the
Crown
The
murder
he
said
was
a
most
premeditated
and
cold-blooded
one
It
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
deliberate
poisoning
of
a
fond
and
trusting
woman
by
the
stepson
to
whom
she
had
been
more
than
a
mother
Ever
since
his
boyhood
she
had
supported
him
He
and
his
wife
had
lived
at
Styles
Court
in
every
luxury
surrounded
by
her
care
and
attention
She
had
been
their
kind
and
generous
benefactress
He
proposed
to
call
witnesses
to
show
how
the
prisoner
a
profligate
and
spendthrift
had
been
at
the
end
of
his
financial
tether
and
had
also
been
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
a
certain
Mrs
a
neighbouring
farmer's
wife
This
having
come
to
his
stepmother's
ears
she
taxed
him
with
it
on
the
afternoon
before
her
death
and
a
quarrel
ensued
part
of
which
was
overheard
On
the
previous
day
the
prisoner
had
purchased
strychnine
at
the
village
chemist's
shop
wearing
a
disguise
by
means
of
which
he
hoped
to
throw
the
onus
of
the
crime
upon
another
manto
wit
Mrs
husband
of
whom
he
had
been
bitterly
jealous
Luckily
for
Mr
he
had
been
able
to
produce
an
unimpeachable
alibi
On
the
afternoon
of
July
continued
Counsel
immediately
after
the
quarrel
with
her
son
Mrs
made
a
new
will
This
will
was
found
destroyed
in
the
grate
of
her
bedroom
the
following
morning
but
evidence
had
come
to
light
which
showed
that
it
had
been
drawn
up
in
favour
of
her
husband
Deceased
had
already
made
a
will
in
his
favour
before
her
marriage
Mr
wagged
an
expressive
prisoner
was
not
aware
of
that
What
had
induced
the
deceased
to
make
a
fresh
will
with
the
old
one
still
extant
he
could
not
say
She
was
an
old
lady
and
might
possibly
have
forgotten
the
former
one
seemed
to
him
more
may
have
had
an
idea
that
it
was
revoked
by
her
marriage
as
there
had
been
some
conversation
on
the
subject
Ladies
were
not
always
very
well
versed
in
legal
knowledge
She
had
about
a
year
before
executed
a
will
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
He
would
call
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
the
prisoner
who
ultimately
handed
his
stepmother
her
coffee
on
the
fatal
night
Later
in
the
evening
he
had
sought
admission
to
her
room
on
which
occasion
no
doubt
he
found
an
opportunity
of
destroying
the
will
which
as
far
as
he
knew
would
render
the
one
in
his
favour
valid
The
prisoner
had
been
arrested
in
consequence
of
the
discovery
in
his
room
by
Detective
Inspector
most
brilliant
the
identical
phial
of
strychnine
which
had
been
sold
at
the
village
chemist's
to
the
supposed
Mr
on
the
day
before
the
murder
It
would
be
for
the
jury
to
decide
whether
or
not
these
damning
facts
constituted
an
overwhelming
proof
of
the
prisoner's
guilt
And
subtly
implying
that
a
jury
which
did
not
so
decide
was
quite
unthinkable
Mr
sat
down
and
wiped
his
forehead
The
first
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
mostly
those
who
had
been
called
at
the
inquest
the
medical
evidence
being
again
taken
first
Sir
Ernest
who
was
famous
all
over
England
for
the
unscrupulous
manner
in
which
he
bullied
witnesses
only
asked
two
questions
I
take
it
Dr
that
strychnine
as
a
drug
acts
quickly
Yes
And
that
you
are
unable
to
account
for
the
delay
in
this
case
Yes
Thank
you
Mr
Mace
identified
the
phial
handed
him
by
Counsel
as
that
sold
by
him
to
Mr
Pressed
he
admitted
that
he
only
knew
Mr
by
sight
He
had
never
spoken
to
him
The
witness
was
not
Alfred
was
called
and
denied
having
purchased
the
poison
He
also
denied
having
quarrelled
with
his
wife
Various
witnesses
testified
to
the
accuracy
of
these
statements
The
gardeners
evidence
as
to
the
witnessing
of
the
will
was
taken
and
then
Dorcas
was
called
Dorcas
faithful
to
her
young
gentlemen
denied
strenuously
that
it
could
have
been
John's
voice
she
heard
and
resolutely
declared
in
the
teeth
of
everything
that
it
was
Mr
who
had
been
in
the
boudoir
with
her
mistress
A
rather
wistful
smile
passed
across
the
face
of
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
He
knew
only
too
well
how
useless
her
gallant
defiance
was
since
it
was
not
the
object
of
the
defence
to
deny
this
point
Mrs
Cavendish
of
course
could
not
be
called
upon
to
give
evidence
against
her
husband
After
various
questions
on
other
matters
Mr
asked
In
the
month
of
June
last
do
you
remember
a
parcel
arriving
for
Mr
Lawrence
Cavendish
from
Dorcas
shook
her
head
I
don't
remember
sir
It
may
have
done
but
Mr
Lawrence
was
away
from
home
part
of
June
In
the
event
of
a
parcel
arriving
for
him
whilst
he
was
away
what
would
be
done
with
it
It
would
either
be
put
in
his
room
or
sent
on
after
him
By
you
No
sir
I
should
leave
it
on
the
hall
table
It
would
be
Miss
who
would
attend
to
anything
like
that
was
called
and
after
being
examined
on
other
points
was
questioned
as
to
the
parcel
Don't
remember
Lots
of
parcels
come
Can't
remember
one
special
one
You
do
not
know
if
it
was
sent
after
Mr
Lawrence
Cavendish
to
Wales
or
whether
it
was
put
in
his
room
Don't
think
it
was
sent
after
him
Should
have
remembered
it
if
it
was
Supposing
a
parcel
arrived
addressed
to
Mr
Lawrence
Cavendish
and
afterwards
it
disappeared
should
you
remark
its
absence
No
don't
think
so
I
should
think
some
one
had
taken
charge
of
it
I
believe
Miss
that
it
was
you
who
found
this
sheet
of
brown
paper
He
held
up
the
same
dusty
piece
which
and
I
had
examined
in
the
at
Styles
Yes
I
did
How
did
you
come
to
look
for
it
The
Belgian
detective
who
was
employed
on
the
case
asked
me
to
search
for
it
Where
did
you
eventually
discover
it
On
the
top
wardrobe
On
top
of
the
prisoner's
wardrobe
II
believe
so
Did
you
not
find
it
yourself
Yes
Then
you
must
know
where
you
found
it
Yes
it
was
on
the
prisoner's
wardrobe
That
is
better
An
assistant
from
Theatrical
testified
that
on
June
they
had
supplied
a
black
beard
to
Mr
L
Cavendish
as
requested
It
was
ordered
by
letter
and
a
postal
order
was
enclosed
No
they
had
not
kept
the
letter
All
transactions
were
entered
in
their
books
They
had
sent
the
beard
as
directed
to
L
Cavendish
Esq
Styles
Court'
Sir
Ernest
rose
Where
was
the
letter
written
from
From
Styles
Court
The
same
address
to
which
you
sent
the
parcel
Yes
And
the
letter
came
from
there
Yes
Like
a
beast
of
prey
fell
upon
him
How
do
you
know
II
don't
understand
How
do
you
know
that
letter
came
from
Styles
Did
you
notice
the
postmark
Ah
you
did
not
notice
the
postmark
And
yet
you
affirm
so
confidently
that
it
came
from
Styles
It
might
in
fact
have
been
any
postmark
Yes
In
fact
the
letter
though
written
on
stamped
notepaper
might
have
been
posted
from
anywhere
From
Wales
for
instance
The
witness
admitted
that
such
might
be
the
case
and
Sir
Ernest
signified
that
he
was
satisfied
Elizabeth
Wells
second
housemaid
at
Styles
stated
that
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
she
remembered
that
she
had
bolted
the
front
door
instead
of
leaving
it
on
the
latch
as
Mr
had
requested
She
had
accordingly
gone
downstairs
again
to
rectify
her
error
Hearing
a
slight
noise
in
the
West
wing
she
had
peeped
along
the
passage
and
had
seen
Mr
John
Cavendish
knocking
at
Mrs
door
Sir
Ernest
made
short
work
of
her
and
under
his
unmerciful
bullying
she
contradicted
herself
hopelessly
and
Sir
Ernest
sat
down
again
with
a
satisfied
smile
on
his
face
With
the
evidence
of
Annie
as
to
the
candle
grease
on
the
floor
and
as
to
seeing
the
prisoner
take
the
coffee
into
the
boudoir
the
proceedings
were
adjourned
until
the
following
day
As
we
went
home
Mary
Cavendish
spoke
bitterly
against
the
prosecuting
counsel
That
hateful
man
What
a
net
he
has
drawn
around
my
poor
John
How
he
twisted
every
little
fact
until
he
made
it
seem
what
it
wasn't
Well
I
said
it
will
be
the
other
way
about
tomorrow
Yes
she
said
then
suddenly
dropped
her
voice
Mr
Hastings
you
do
not
it
could
not
have
been
no
that
could
not
be
But
I
myself
was
puzzled
and
as
soon
as
I
was
alone
with
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
Sir
Ernest
was
driving
at
Ah
said
appreciatively
He
is
a
clever
man
that
Sir
Ernest
Do
you
think
he
believes
Lawrence
guilty
I
do
not
think
he
believes
or
cares
anything
No
what
he
is
trying
for
is
to
create
such
confusion
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
that
they
are
divided
in
their
opinion
as
to
which
brother
did
it
He
is
endeavouring
to
make
out
that
there
is
quite
as
much
evidence
against
Lawrence
as
against
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
he
will
not
succeed
was
the
first
witness
called
when
the
trial
was
reopened
and
gave
his
evidence
succinctly
and
briefly
After
relating
the
earlier
events
he
proceeded
Acting
on
information
received
Superintendent
and
myself
searched
the
prisoner's
room
during
his
temporary
absence
from
the
house
In
his
chest
of
drawers
hidden
beneath
some
underclothing
we
found
first
a
pair
of
similar
to
those
worn
by
Mr
these
were
exhibited
secondly
this
phial
The
phial
was
that
already
recognized
by
the
chemist's
assistant
a
tiny
bottle
of
blue
glass
containing
a
few
grains
of
a
white
crystalline
powder
and
labelled
Strychnine
Hydrochloride
POISON
A
fresh
piece
of
evidence
discovered
by
the
detectives
since
the
police
court
proceedings
was
a
long
almost
new
piece
of
It
had
been
found
in
Mrs
cheque
book
and
on
being
reversed
at
a
mirror
showed
clearly
the
words
of
which
I
die
possessed
I
leave
to
my
beloved
husband
Alfred
Ing
This
placed
beyond
question
the
fact
that
the
destroyed
will
had
been
in
favour
of
the
deceased
husband
then
produced
the
charred
fragment
of
paper
recovered
from
the
grate
and
this
with
the
discovery
of
the
beard
in
the
attic
completed
his
evidence
But
Sir
was
yet
to
come
What
day
was
it
when
you
searched
the
prisoner's
room
Tuesday
the
of
July
Exactly
a
week
after
the
tragedy
Yes
You
found
these
two
objects
you
say
in
the
chest
of
drawers
Was
the
drawer
unlocked
Yes
Does
it
not
strike
you
as
unlikely
that
a
man
who
had
committed
a
crime
should
keep
the
evidence
of
it
in
an
unlocked
drawer
for
anyone
to
find
He
might
have
stowed
them
there
in
a
hurry
But
you
have
just
said
it
was
a
whole
week
since
the
crime
He
would
have
had
ample
time
to
remove
them
and
destroy
them
Perhaps
There
is
no
perhaps
about
it
Would
he
or
would
he
not
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
remove
and
destroy
them
Yes
Was
the
pile
of
underclothes
under
which
the
things
were
hidden
heavy
or
light
In
other
words
it
was
winter
underclothing
Obviously
the
prisoner
would
not
be
likely
to
go
to
that
drawer
Perhaps
not
Kindly
answer
my
question
Would
the
prisoner
in
the
hottest
week
of
a
hot
summer
be
likely
to
go
to
a
drawer
containing
winter
underclothing
Yes
or
no
No
In
that
case
is
it
not
possible
that
the
articles
in
question
might
have
been
put
there
by
a
third
person
and
that
the
prisoner
was
quite
unaware
of
their
presence
I
should
not
think
it
likely
But
it
is
possible
Yes
That
is
all
More
evidence
followed
Evidence
as
to
the
financial
difficulties
in
which
the
prisoner
had
found
himself
at
the
end
of
July
Evidence
as
to
his
intrigue
with
Mrs
Mary
that
must
have
been
bitter
hearing
for
a
woman
of
her
pride
had
been
right
in
her
facts
though
her
animosity
against
Alfred
had
caused
her
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
the
person
concerned
Lawrence
Cavendish
was
then
put
into
the
box
In
a
low
voice
in
answer
to
Mr
questions
he
denied
having
ordered
anything
from
in
June
In
fact
on
June
he
had
been
staying
away
in
Wales
Instantly
Sir
chin
was
shooting
forward
You
deny
having
ordered
a
black
beard
from
on
June
I
do
Ah
In
the
event
of
anything
happening
to
your
brother
who
will
inherit
Styles
Court
The
brutality
of
the
question
called
a
flush
to
pale
face
The
judge
gave
vent
to
a
faint
murmur
of
and
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
leant
forward
angrily
cared
nothing
for
his
client's
anger
Answer
my
question
if
you
please
I
suppose
said
Lawrence
quietly
that
I
should
What
do
you
mean
by
you
suppose'
Your
brother
has
no
children
You
would
inherit
it
wouldn't
you
Yes
Ah
that's
better
said
with
ferocious
geniality
And
you'd
inherit
a
good
slice
of
money
too
wouldn't
you
Really
Sir
Ernest
protested
the
judge
these
questions
are
not
relevant
Sir
Ernest
bowed
and
having
shot
his
arrow
proceeded
On
Tuesday
the
July
you
went
I
believe
with
another
guest
to
visit
the
dispensary
at
the
Red
Cross
Hospital
in
Yes
Did
you
while
you
happened
to
be
alone
for
a
few
seconds
unlock
the
poison
cupboard
and
examine
some
of
the
bottles
have
done
so
I
put
it
to
you
that
you
did
do
so
Yes
Sir
Ernest
fairly
shot
the
next
question
at
him
Did
you
examine
one
bottle
in
particular
No
I
do
not
think
so
Be
careful
Mr
Cavendish
I
am
referring
to
a
little
bottle
of
Hydro-chloride
Hydro-chloride
of
Strychnine
Lawrence
was
turning
a
sickly
greenish
colour
am
sure
I
didn't
Then
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
you
left
the
unmistakable
impress
of
your
finger-prints
on
it
The
bullying
manner
was
highly
efficacious
with
a
nervous
disposition
II
suppose
I
must
have
taken
up
the
bottle
I
suppose
so
too
Did
you
abstract
any
of
the
contents
of
the
bottle
Certainly
not
Then
why
did
you
take
it
up
I
once
studied
to
be
a
doctor
Such
things
naturally
interest
me
Ah
So
poisons
naturally
interest'
you
do
they
Still
you
waited
to
be
alone
before
gratifying
that
interest
of
yours
That
was
pure
chance
If
the
others
had
been
there
I
should
have
done
just
the
same
Still
as
it
happens
the
others
were
not
there
No
but
In
fact
during
the
whole
afternoon
you
were
only
alone
for
a
couple
of
minutes
and
it
say
it
be
during
those
two
minutes
that
you
displayed
your
natural
interest
in
Hydro-chloride
of
Strychnine
Lawrence
stammered
II
With
a
satisfied
and
expressive
countenance
Sir
Ernest
observed
I
have
nothing
more
to
ask
you
Mr
Cavendish
This
bit
of
had
caused
great
excitement
in
court
The
heads
of
the
many
fashionably
attired
women
present
were
busily
laid
together
and
their
whispers
became
so
loud
that
the
judge
angrily
threatened
to
have
the
court
cleared
if
there
was
not
immediate
silence
There
was
little
more
evidence
The
hand-writing
experts
were
called
upon
for
their
opinion
of
the
signature
of
Alfred
in
the
chemist's
poison
register
They
all
declared
unanimously
that
it
was
certainly
not
his
hand-writing
and
gave
it
as
their
view
that
it
might
be
that
of
the
prisoner
disguised
they
admitted
that
it
might
be
the
prisoner's
hand-writing
cleverly
counterfeited
Sir
Ernest
speech
in
opening
the
case
for
the
defence
was
not
a
long
one
but
it
was
backed
by
the
full
force
of
his
emphatic
manner
Never
he
said
in
the
course
of
his
long
experience
had
he
known
a
charge
of
murder
rest
on
slighter
evidence
Not
only
was
it
entirely
circumstantial
but
the
greater
part
of
it
was
practically
unproved
Let
them
take
the
testimony
they
had
heard
and
sift
it
impartially
The
strychnine
had
been
found
in
a
drawer
in
the
prisoner's
room
That
drawer
was
an
unlocked
one
as
he
had
pointed
out
and
he
submitted
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
prove
that
it
was
the
prisoner
who
had
concealed
the
poison
there
It
was
in
fact
a
wicked
and
malicious
attempt
on
the
part
of
some
third
person
to
fix
the
crime
on
the
prisoner
The
prosecution
had
been
unable
to
produce
a
shred
of
evidence
in
support
of
their
contention
that
it
was
the
prisoner
who
ordered
the
black
beard
from
The
quarrel
which
had
taken
place
between
prisoner
and
his
stepmother
was
freely
admitted
but
both
it
and
his
financial
embarrassments
had
been
grossly
exaggerated
His
learned
friend
Sir
Ernest
nodded
carelessly
at
Mr
had
stated
that
if
the
prisoner
were
an
innocent
man
he
would
have
come
forward
at
the
inquest
to
explain
that
it
was
he
and
not
Mr
who
had
been
the
participator
in
the
quarrel
He
thought
the
facts
had
been
misrepresented
What
had
actually
occurred
was
this
The
prisoner
returning
to
the
house
on
Tuesday
evening
had
been
authoritatively
told
that
there
had
been
a
violent
quarrel
between
Mr
and
Mrs
No
suspicion
had
entered
the
prisoner's
head
that
anyone
could
possibly
have
mistaken
his
voice
for
that
of
Mr
He
naturally
concluded
that
his
stepmother
had
had
two
quarrels
The
prosecution
that
on
Monday
July
the
prisoner
had
entered
the
chemist's
shop
in
the
village
disguised
as
Mr
The
prisoner
on
the
contrary
was
at
that
time
at
a
lonely
spot
called
Spinney
where
he
had
been
summoned
by
an
anonymous
note
couched
in
blackmailing
terms
and
threatening
to
reveal
certain
matters
to
his
wife
unless
he
complied
with
its
demands
The
prisoner
had
accordingly
gone
to
the
appointed
spot
and
after
waiting
there
vainly
for
half
an
hour
had
returned
home
Unfortunately
he
had
met
with
no
one
on
the
way
there
or
back
who
could
vouch
for
the
truth
of
his
story
but
luckily
he
had
kept
the
note
and
it
would
be
produced
as
evidence
As
for
the
statement
relating
to
the
destruction
of
the
will
the
prisoner
had
formerly
practiced
at
the
Bar
and
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
the
will
made
in
his
favour
a
year
before
was
automatically
revoked
by
his
stepmother's
remarriage
He
would
call
evidence
to
show
who
did
destroy
the
will
and
it
was
possible
that
that
might
open
up
quite
a
new
view
of
the
case
Finally
he
would
point
out
to
the
jury
that
there
was
evidence
against
other
people
besides
John
Cavendish
He
would
direct
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
against
Mr
Lawrence
Cavendish
was
quite
as
strong
if
not
stronger
than
that
against
his
brother
He
would
now
call
the
prisoner
John
acquitted
himself
well
in
the
Under
Sir
skilful
handling
he
told
his
tale
credibly
and
well
The
anonymous
note
received
by
him
was
produced
and
handed
to
the
jury
to
examine
The
readiness
with
which
he
admitted
his
financial
difficulties
and
the
disagreement
with
his
stepmother
lent
value
to
his
denials
At
the
close
of
his
examination
he
paused
and
said
I
should
like
to
make
one
thing
clear
I
utterly
reject
and
disapprove
of
Sir
Ernest
insinuations
against
my
brother
My
brother
I
am
convinced
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
crime
than
I
have
Sir
Ernest
merely
smiled
and
noted
with
a
sharp
eye
that
John's
protest
had
produced
a
very
favourable
impression
on
the
jury
Then
the
began
I
understand
you
to
say
that
it
never
entered
your
head
that
the
witnesses
at
the
inquest
could
possibly
have
mistaken
your
voice
for
that
of
Mr
Is
not
that
very
surprising
No
I
don't
think
so
I
was
told
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
my
mother
and
Mr
and
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
such
was
not
really
the
case
Not
when
the
servant
Dorcas
repeated
certain
fragments
of
the
which
you
must
have
recognized
I
did
not
recognize
them
Your
memory
must
be
unusually
short
No
but
we
were
both
angry
and
I
think
said
more
than
we
meant
I
paid
very
little
attention
to
my
mother's
actual
words
Mr
incredulous
sniff
was
a
triumph
of
forensic
skill
He
passed
on
to
the
subject
of
the
have
produced
this
note
very
opportunely
Tell
me
is
there
nothing
familiar
about
the
hand-writing
of
it
Not
that
I
know
of
Do
you
not
think
that
it
bears
a
marked
resemblance
to
your
own
disguised
No
I
do
not
think
so
I
put
it
to
you
that
it
is
your
own
hand-writing
No
I
put
it
to
you
that
anxious
to
prove
an
alibi
you
conceived
the
idea
of
a
fictitious
and
rather
incredible
appointment
and
wrote
this
note
yourself
in
order
to
bear
out
your
statement
No
Is
it
not
a
fact
that
at
the
time
you
claim
to
have
been
waiting
about
at
a
solitary
and
spot
you
were
really
in
the
chemist's
shop
in
Styles
St
Mary
where
you
purchased
strychnine
in
the
name
of
Alfred
No
that
is
a
lie
I
put
it
to
you
that
wearing
a
suit
of
Mr
clothes
with
a
black
beard
trimmed
to
resemble
his
you
were
signed
the
register
in
his
name
That
is
absolutely
untrue
Then
I
will
leave
the
remarkable
similarity
of
hand-writing
between
the
note
the
register
and
your
own
to
the
consideration
of
the
jury
said
Mr
and
sat
down
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
done
his
duty
but
who
was
nevertheless
horrified
by
such
deliberate
perjury
After
this
as
it
was
growing
late
the
case
was
adjourned
till
Monday
I
noticed
was
looking
profoundly
discouraged
He
had
that
little
frown
between
the
eyes
that
I
knew
so
well
What
is
it
I
inquired
Ah
mon
ami
things
are
going
badly
badly
In
spite
of
myself
my
heart
gave
a
leap
of
relief
Evidently
there
was
a
likelihood
of
John
Cavendish
being
acquitted
When
we
reached
the
house
my
little
friend
waved
aside
Mary's
offer
of
tea
No
I
thank
you
madame
I
will
mount
to
my
room
I
followed
him
Still
frowning
he
went
across
to
the
desk
and
took
out
a
small
pack
of
patience
cards
Then
he
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
and
to
my
utter
amazement
began
solemnly
to
build
card
houses
My
jaw
dropped
involuntarily
and
he
said
at
once
No
mon
ami
I
am
not
in
my
second
childhood
I
steady
my
nerves
that
is
all
This
employment
requires
precision
of
the
fingers
With
precision
of
the
fingers
goes
precision
of
the
brain
And
never
have
I
needed
that
more
than
now
What
is
the
trouble
I
asked
With
a
great
thump
on
the
table
demolished
his
carefully
built
up
edifice
It
is
this
mon
ami
That
I
can
build
card
houses
seven
stories
high
but
I
cannot
thump
find
thump
that
last
link
of
which
I
spoke
to
you
I
could
not
quite
tell
what
to
say
so
I
held
my
peace
and
he
began
slowly
building
up
the
cards
again
speaking
in
jerks
as
he
did
so
It
is
By
cardon
I
watched
the
card
house
rising
under
his
hands
story
by
story
He
never
hesitated
or
faltered
It
was
really
almost
like
a
conjuring
trick
What
a
steady
hand
you've
got
I
remarked
I
believe
I've
only
seen
your
hand
shake
once
On
an
occasion
when
I
was
enraged
without
doubt
observed
with
great
Yes
indeed
You
were
in
a
towering
rage
Do
you
remember
It
was
when
you
discovered
that
the
lock
of
the
in
Mrs
bedroom
had
been
forced
You
stood
by
the
mantel-piece
twiddling
the
things
on
it
in
your
usual
fashion
and
your
hand
shook
like
a
leaf
I
must
say
But
I
stopped
suddenly
For
uttering
a
hoarse
and
inarticulate
cry
again
annihilated
his
masterpiece
of
cards
and
putting
his
hands
over
his
eyes
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
apparently
suffering
the
keenest
agony
Good
heavens
I
cried
What
is
the
matter
Are
you
taken
ill
No
no
he
gasped
It
I
have
an
idea
Oh
I
exclaimed
much
relieved
One
of
your
little
ideas
Ah
ma
no
replied
frankly
This
time
it
is
an
idea
gigantic
Stupendous
And
my
friend
have
given
it
to
me
Suddenly
clasping
me
in
his
arms
he
kissed
me
warmly
on
both
cheeks
and
before
I
had
recovered
from
my
surprise
ran
headlong
from
the
room
Mary
Cavendish
entered
at
that
moment
What
is
the
matter
with
Monsieur
He
rushed
past
me
crying
out
A
garage
For
the
love
of
Heaven
direct
me
to
a
garage
madame'
And
before
I
could
answer
he
had
dashed
out
into
the
hurried
to
the
window
true
enough
there
he
was
tearing
down
the
street
hatless
and
gesticulating
as
he
went
I
turned
to
Mary
with
a
gesture
of
despair
He'll
be
stopped
by
a
policeman
in
another
minute
There
he
goes
round
the
corner
Our
eyes
met
and
we
stared
helplessly
at
one
another
What
can
be
the
matter
I
shook
my
head
I
don't
know
He
was
building
card
houses
when
suddenly
he
said
he
had
an
idea
and
rushed
off
as
you
saw
Well
said
Mary
I
expect
he
will
be
back
before
dinner
But
night
fell
and
had
not
returned
abrupt
departure
had
intrigued
us
all
greatly
Sunday
morning
wore
away
and
still
he
did
not
reappear
But
about
three
o'clock
a
ferocious
and
prolonged
hooting
outside
drove
us
to
the
window
to
see
alighting
from
a
car
accompanied
by
and
The
little
man
was
transformed
He
radiated
an
absurd
complacency
He
bowed
with
exaggerated
respect
to
Mary
Cavendish
Madame
I
have
your
permission
to
hold
a
little
reunion
in
the
salon
It
is
necessary
for
every
one
to
attend
Mary
smiled
sadly
You
know
Monsieur
that
you
have
carte
blanche
in
every
way
You
are
too
amiable
madame
Still
beaming
us
all
into
the
bringing
forward
chairs
as
he
did
so
Miss
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
Monsieur
Lawrence
The
good
Dorcas
And
Annie
Bien
We
must
delay
our
proceedings
a
few
minutes
until
Mr
arrives
I
have
sent
him
a
note
Miss
rose
immediately
from
her
seat
If
that
man
comes
into
the
house
I
leave
it
No
no
went
up
to
her
and
pleaded
in
a
low
voice
Finally
Miss
consented
to
return
to
her
chair
A
few
minutes
later
Alfred
entered
the
room
The
company
once
assembled
rose
from
his
seat
with
the
air
of
a
popular
lecturer
and
bowed
politely
to
his
audience
Messieurs
mesdames
as
you
all
know
I
was
called
in
by
Monsieur
John
Cavendish
to
investigate
this
case
I
at
once
examined
the
bedroom
of
the
deceased
which
by
the
advice
of
the
doctors
had
been
kept
locked
and
was
consequently
exactly
as
it
had
been
when
the
tragedy
occurred
I
found
first
a
fragment
of
green
material
second
a
stain
on
the
carpet
near
the
window
still
damp
thirdly
an
empty
box
of
bromide
powders
To
take
the
fragment
of
green
material
first
I
found
it
caught
in
the
bolt
of
the
communicating
door
between
that
room
and
the
adjoining
one
occupied
by
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
I
handed
the
fragment
over
to
the
police
who
did
not
consider
it
of
much
importance
Nor
did
they
recognize
it
for
what
it
piece
torn
from
a
green
land
There
was
a
little
stir
of
excitement
Now
there
was
only
one
person
at
Styles
who
worked
on
the
Cavendish
Therefore
it
must
have
been
Mrs
Cavendish
who
entered
the
room
through
the
door
communicating
with
Mademoiselle
room
But
that
door
was
bolted
on
the
inside
I
cried
When
I
examined
the
room
yes
But
in
the
first
place
we
have
only
her
word
for
it
since
it
was
she
who
tried
that
particular
door
and
reported
it
fastened
In
the
ensuing
confusion
she
would
have
had
ample
opportunity
to
shoot
the
bolt
across
I
took
an
early
opportunity
of
verifying
my
conjectures
To
begin
with
the
fragment
corresponds
exactly
with
a
tear
in
Mrs
Also
at
the
inquest
Mrs
Cavendish
declared
that
she
had
heard
from
her
own
room
the
fall
of
the
table
by
the
bed
I
took
an
early
opportunity
of
testing
that
statement
by
my
friend
Monsieur
Hastings
in
the
left
wing
of
the
building
just
outside
Mrs
door
I
myself
in
company
with
the
police
went
to
the
room
and
whilst
there
I
apparently
accidentally
knocked
over
the
table
in
question
but
found
that
as
I
had
expected
Monsieur
Hastings
had
heard
no
sound
at
all
This
confirmed
my
belief
that
Mrs
Cavendish
was
not
speaking
the
truth
when
she
declared
that
she
had
been
dressing
in
her
room
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
In
fact
I
was
convinced
that
far
from
having
been
in
her
own
room
Mrs
Cavendish
was
actually
in
the
room
when
the
alarm
was
given
I
shot
a
quick
glance
at
Mary
She
was
very
pale
but
smiling
I
proceeded
to
reason
on
that
assumption
Mrs
Cavendish
is
in
her
room
We
will
say
that
she
is
seeking
for
something
and
has
not
yet
found
it
Suddenly
Mrs
awakens
and
is
seized
with
an
alarming
paroxysm
She
flings
out
her
arm
overturning
the
bed
table
and
then
pulls
desperately
at
the
bell
Mrs
Cavendish
startled
drops
her
candle
scattering
the
grease
on
the
carpet
She
picks
it
up
and
retreats
quickly
to
Mademoiselle
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
She
hurries
out
into
the
passage
for
the
servants
must
not
find
her
where
she
is
But
it
is
too
late
Already
footsteps
are
echoing
along
the
gallery
which
connects
the
two
wings
What
can
she
do
Quick
as
thought
she
hurries
back
to
the
young
girl's
room
and
starts
shaking
her
awake
The
hastily
aroused
household
come
trooping
down
the
passage
They
are
all
busily
battering
at
Mrs
door
It
occurs
to
nobody
that
Mrs
Cavendish
has
not
arrived
with
the
rest
this
is
can
find
no
one
who
saw
her
come
from
the
other
wing
He
looked
at
Mary
Cavendish
Am
I
right
madame
She
bowed
her
head
Quite
right
monsieur
You
understand
that
if
I
had
thought
I
would
do
my
husband
any
good
by
revealing
these
facts
I
would
have
done
so
But
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
bear
upon
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
In
a
sense
that
is
correct
madame
But
it
cleared
my
mind
of
many
misconceptions
and
left
me
free
to
see
other
facts
in
their
true
significance
The
will
cried
Lawrence
Then
it
was
you
Mary
who
destroyed
the
will
She
shook
her
head
and
shook
his
also
No
he
said
quietly
There
is
only
one
person
who
could
possibly
have
destroyed
that
herself
Impossible
I
exclaimed
She
had
only
made
it
out
that
very
afternoon
Nevertheless
mon
ami
it
was
Mrs
Because
in
no
other
way
can
you
account
for
the
fact
that
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
Mrs
ordered
a
fire
to
be
lighted
in
her
room
I
gave
a
gasp
What
idiots
we
had
been
never
to
think
of
that
fire
as
being
incongruous
was
continuing
The
temperature
on
that
day
messieurs
was
degrees
in
the
shade
Yet
Mrs
ordered
a
fire
Why
Because
she
wished
to
destroy
something
and
could
think
of
no
other
way
You
will
remember
that
in
consequence
of
the
War
economics
practiced
at
Styles
no
waste
paper
was
thrown
away
There
was
therefore
no
means
of
destroying
a
thick
document
such
as
a
will
The
moment
I
heard
of
a
fire
being
lighted
in
Mrs
room
I
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
to
destroy
some
important
a
will
So
the
discovery
of
the
charred
fragment
in
the
grate
was
no
surprise
to
me
I
did
not
of
course
know
at
the
time
that
the
will
in
question
had
only
been
made
this
afternoon
and
I
will
admit
that
when
I
learnt
that
fact
I
fell
into
a
grievous
error
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
Mrs
determination
to
destroy
her
will
arose
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
quarrel
she
had
that
afternoon
and
that
therefore
the
quarrel
took
place
after
and
not
before
the
making
of
the
will
Here
as
we
know
I
was
wrong
and
I
was
forced
to
abandon
that
idea
I
faced
the
problem
from
a
new
standpoint
Now
at
o'clock
Dorcas
overheard
her
mistress
saying
angrily
You
need
not
think
that
any
fear
of
publicity
or
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
will
deter
me'
I
and
rightly
that
these
words
were
addressed
not
to
her
husband
but
to
Mr
John
Cavendish
At
o'clock
an
hour
later
she
uses
almost
the
same
words
but
the
standpoint
is
different
She
admits
to
Dorcas
I
don't
know
what
to
do
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
is
a
dreadful
thing
At
o'clock
she
has
been
angry
but
completely
mistress
of
herself
At
o'clock
she
is
in
violent
distress
and
speaks
of
having
had
a
great
shock
Looking
at
the
matter
psychologically
I
drew
one
deduction
which
I
was
convinced
was
correct
The
second
scandal
she
spoke
of
was
not
the
same
as
the
it
concerned
herself
Let
us
reconstruct
At
o'clock
Mrs
quarrels
with
her
son
and
threatens
to
denounce
him
to
his
by
the
way
overheard
the
greater
part
of
the
conversation
At
Mrs
in
consequence
of
a
conversation
on
the
validity
of
wills
makes
a
will
in
favour
of
her
husband
which
the
two
gardeners
witness
At
o'clock
Dorcas
finds
her
mistress
in
a
state
of
considerable
agitation
with
a
slip
of
letter
Dorcas
her
hand
and
it
is
then
that
she
orders
the
fire
in
her
room
to
be
lighted
Presumably
then
between
and
o'clock
something
has
occurred
to
occasion
a
complete
revolution
of
feeling
since
she
is
now
as
anxious
to
destroy
the
will
as
she
was
before
to
make
it
What
was
that
something
As
far
as
we
know
she
was
quite
alone
during
that
Nobody
entered
or
left
that
boudoir
What
then
occasioned
this
sudden
change
of
sentiment
One
can
only
guess
but
I
believe
my
guess
to
be
correct
Mrs
had
no
stamps
in
her
desk
We
know
this
because
later
she
asked
Dorcas
to
bring
her
some
Now
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
stood
her
husband's
She
was
anxious
to
find
some
stamps
and
according
to
my
theory
she
tried
her
own
keys
in
the
desk
That
one
of
them
fitted
I
know
She
therefore
opened
the
desk
and
in
searching
for
the
stamps
she
came
across
something
slip
of
paper
which
Dorcas
saw
in
her
hand
and
which
assuredly
was
never
meant
for
Mrs
eyes
On
the
other
hand
Mrs
Cavendish
believed
that
the
slip
of
paper
to
which
her
clung
so
tenaciously
was
a
written
proof
of
her
own
husband's
infidelity
She
demanded
it
from
Mrs
who
assured
her
quite
truly
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
matter
Mrs
Cavendish
did
not
believe
her
She
thought
that
Mrs
was
shielding
her
stepson
Now
Mrs
Cavendish
is
a
very
resolute
woman
and
behind
her
mask
of
reserve
she
was
madly
jealous
of
her
husband
She
determined
to
get
hold
of
that
paper
at
all
costs
and
in
this
resolution
chance
came
to
her
aid
She
happened
to
pick
up
the
key
of
Mrs
which
had
been
lost
that
morning
She
knew
that
her
invariably
kept
all
important
papers
in
this
particular
case
Mrs
Cavendish
therefore
made
her
plans
as
only
a
woman
driven
desperate
through
jealousy
could
have
done
Some
time
in
the
evening
she
the
door
leading
into
Mademoiselle
room
Possibly
she
applied
oil
to
the
hinges
for
I
found
that
it
opened
quite
noiselessly
when
I
tried
it
She
put
off
her
project
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
being
safer
since
the
servants
were
accustomed
to
hearing
her
move
about
her
room
at
that
time
She
dressed
completely
in
her
land
kit
and
made
her
way
quietly
through
Mademoiselle
room
into
that
of
Mrs
He
paused
a
moment
and
Cynthia
interrupted
But
I
should
have
woken
up
if
anyone
had
come
through
my
room
Not
if
you
were
drugged
mademoiselle
Drugged
oui
You
addressed
us
collectively
through
all
the
tumult
and
noise
next
door
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
slept
That
admitted
of
two
possibilities
Either
her
sleep
was
I
did
not
her
unconsciousness
was
indeed
by
artificial
means
With
this
latter
idea
in
my
mind
I
examined
all
the
most
carefully
remembering
that
it
was
Mrs
Cavendish
who
had
brought
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
her
coffee
the
night
before
I
took
a
sample
from
each
cup
and
had
them
no
result
I
had
counted
the
cups
carefully
in
the
event
of
one
having
been
removed
Six
persons
had
taken
coffee
and
six
cups
were
duly
found
I
had
to
confess
myself
mistaken
Then
I
discovered
that
I
had
been
guilty
of
a
very
grave
oversight
Coffee
had
been
brought
in
for
seven
persons
not
six
for
had
been
there
that
evening
This
changed
the
face
of
the
whole
affair
for
there
was
now
one
cup
missing
The
servants
noticed
nothing
since
Annie
the
housemaid
who
took
in
the
coffee
brought
in
seven
cups
not
knowing
that
Mr
never
drank
it
whereas
Dorcas
who
cleared
them
away
the
following
morning
found
six
as
strictly
speaking
she
found
five
the
sixth
being
the
one
found
broken
in
Mrs
room
I
was
confident
that
the
missing
cup
was
that
of
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
I
had
an
additional
reason
for
that
belief
in
the
fact
that
all
the
cups
found
contained
sugar
which
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
never
took
in
her
coffee
My
attention
was
attracted
by
the
story
of
Annie
about
some
salt
on
the
tray
of
cocoa
which
she
took
every
night
to
Mrs
room
I
accordingly
secured
a
sample
of
that
cocoa
and
sent
it
to
be
analysed
But
that
had
already
been
done
by
Dr
said
Lawrence
quickly
Not
exactly
The
analyst
was
asked
by
him
to
report
whether
strychnine
was
or
was
not
present
He
did
not
have
it
tested
as
I
did
for
a
narcotic
For
a
narcotic
Yes
Here
is
the
analyst's
report
Mrs
Cavendish
administered
a
safe
but
effectual
narcotic
to
both
Mrs
and
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
And
it
is
possible
that
she
had
a
quart
in
consequence
Imagine
her
feelings
when
her
is
suddenly
taken
ill
and
dies
and
immediately
after
she
hears
the
word
posion
She
has
believed
that
the
sleeping
draught
she
administered
was
perfectly
harmless
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
for
one
terrible
moment
she
must
have
feared
that
Mrs
death
lay
at
her
door
She
is
seized
with
panic
and
under
its
influence
she
hurries
downstairs
and
quickly
drops
the
and
saucer
used
by
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
into
a
large
brass
vase
where
it
is
discovered
later
by
Monsieur
Lawrence
The
remains
of
the
cocoa
she
dare
not
touch
Too
many
eyes
are
upon
her
Guess
at
her
relief
when
strychnine
is
mentioned
and
she
discovers
that
after
all
the
tragedy
is
not
her
doing
We
are
now
able
to
account
for
the
symptoms
of
strychnine
poisoning
being
so
long
in
making
their
appearance
A
narcotic
taken
with
strychnine
will
delay
the
action
of
the
poison
for
some
hours
paused
Mary
looked
up
at
him
the
colour
slowly
rising
in
her
face
All
you
have
said
is
quite
true
Monsieur
It
was
the
most
awful
hour
of
my
life
I
shall
never
forget
it
But
you
are
wonderful
I
understand
now
What
I
meant
when
I
told
you
that
you
could
safely
confess
to
Papa
eh
But
you
would
not
trust
me
I
see
everything
now
said
Lawrence
The
drugged
cocoa
taken
on
top
of
the
poisoned
coffee
amply
accounts
for
the
delay
Exactly
But
was
the
coffee
poisoned
or
was
it
not
We
come
to
a
little
difficulty
here
since
Mrs
never
drank
it
What
The
cry
of
surprise
was
universal
No
You
will
remember
my
speaking
of
a
stain
on
the
carpet
in
Mrs
room
There
were
some
peculiar
points
about
that
stain
It
was
still
damp
it
exhaled
a
strong
odour
of
coffee
and
imbedded
in
the
nap
of
the
carpet
I
found
some
little
splinters
of
china
What
had
happened
was
plain
to
me
for
not
two
minutes
before
I
had
placed
my
little
case
on
the
table
near
the
window
and
the
table
tilting
up
had
deposited
it
upon
the
floor
on
precisely
the
identical
spot
In
exactly
the
same
way
Mrs
had
laid
down
her
cup
of
coffee
on
reaching
her
room
the
night
before
and
the
treacherous
table
had
played
her
the
same
trick
What
happened
next
is
mere
guess
work
on
my
part
but
I
should
say
that
Mrs
picked
up
the
broken
cup
and
placed
it
on
the
table
by
the
bed
Feeling
in
need
of
a
stimulant
of
some
kind
she
heated
up
her
cocoa
and
drank
it
off
then
and
there
Now
we
are
faced
with
a
new
problem
We
know
the
cocoa
contained
no
strychnine
The
coffee
was
never
drunk
Yet
the
strychnine
must
have
been
administered
between
seven
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
What
third
medium
was
medium
so
suitable
for
disguising
the
taste
of
strychnine
that
it
is
extraordinary
no
one
has
thought
of
it
looked
round
the
room
and
then
answered
himself
impressively
Her
medicine
Do
you
mean
that
the
murderer
introduced
the
strychnine
into
her
tonic
I
cried
There
was
no
need
to
introduce
it
It
was
already
therein
the
mixture
The
strychnine
that
killed
Mrs
was
the
identical
strychnine
prescribed
by
Dr
To
make
that
clear
to
you
I
will
read
you
an
extract
from
a
book
on
dispensing
which
I
found
in
the
Dispensary
of
the
Red
Cross
Hospital
at
The
following
prescription
has
become
famous
in
text
books
mixed
with
Bromide
This
solution
deposits
in
a
few
hours
the
greater
part
of
the
strychnine
salt
as
an
insoluble
bromide
in
transparent
crystals
A
lady
in
England
lost
her
life
by
taking
a
similar
mixture
the
precipitated
strychnine
collected
at
the
bottom
and
in
taking
the
last
dose
she
swallowed
nearly
all
of
it'
Now
there
was
of
course
no
bromide
in
Dr
prescription
but
you
will
remember
that
I
mentioned
an
empty
box
of
bromide
powders
One
or
two
of
those
powders
introduced
into
the
full
bottle
of
medicine
would
precipitate
the
strychnine
as
the
book
describes
and
cause
it
to
be
taken
in
the
last
dose
You
will
learn
later
that
the
person
who
usually
poured
out
Mrs
medicine
was
always
extremely
careful
not
to
shake
the
bottle
but
to
leave
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
it
undisturbed
Throughout
the
case
there
have
been
evidences
that
the
tragedy
was
intended
to
take
place
on
Monday
evening
On
that
day
Mrs
bell
wire
was
neatly
cut
and
on
Monday
evening
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
was
spending
the
night
with
friends
so
that
Mrs
would
have
been
quite
alone
in
the
right
wing
completely
shut
off
from
help
of
any
kind
and
would
have
died
in
all
probability
before
medical
aid
could
have
been
summoned
But
in
her
hurry
to
be
in
time
for
the
village
entertainment
Mrs
forgot
to
take
her
medicine
and
the
next
day
she
lunched
away
from
home
so
that
the
was
actually
taken
hours
later
than
had
been
anticipated
by
the
murderer
and
it
is
owing
to
that
delay
that
the
final
last
link
of
the
now
in
my
hands
Amid
breathless
excitement
he
held
out
three
thin
strips
of
paper
A
letter
in
the
murderer's
own
hand-writing
amis
Had
it
been
a
little
clearer
in
its
terms
it
is
possible
that
Mrs
warned
in
time
would
have
escaped
As
it
was
she
realized
her
danger
but
not
the
manner
of
it
In
the
deathly
silence
pieced
together
the
slips
of
paper
and
clearing
his
throat
read
Dearest
You
will
be
anxious
at
hearing
nothing
It
is
all
it
will
be
tonight
instead
of
last
night
You
understand
There's
a
good
time
coming
once
the
old
woman
is
dead
and
out
of
the
way
No
one
can
possibly
bring
home
the
crime
to
me
That
idea
of
yours
about
the
bromides
was
a
stroke
of
genius
But
we
must
be
very
circumspect
A
False
step
Here
my
friends
the
letter
breaks
off
Doubtless
the
writer
was
interrupted
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
his
identity
We
all
know
this
hand-writing
and
A
howl
that
was
almost
a
scream
broke
the
silence
You
devil
How
did
you
get
it
A
chair
was
overturned
skipped
nimbly
aside
A
quick
movement
on
his
part
and
his
assailant
fell
with
a
crash
Messieurs
mesdames
said
with
a
flourish
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
murderer
Mr
Alfred
you
old
villain
I
said
I've
half
a
mind
to
strangle
you
What
do
you
mean
by
deceiving
me
as
you
have
done
We
were
sitting
in
the
library
Several
hectic
days
lay
behind
us
In
the
room
below
John
and
Mary
were
together
once
more
while
Alfred
and
Miss
were
in
custody
Now
at
last
I
had
to
myself
and
could
relieve
my
still
burning
curiosity
did
not
answer
me
for
a
moment
but
at
last
he
said
I
did
not
deceive
you
mon
ami
At
most
I
permitted
you
to
deceive
yourself
Yes
but
why
Well
it
is
difficult
to
explain
You
see
my
friend
you
have
a
nature
so
honest
and
a
countenance
so
transparent
to
conceal
your
feelings
is
impossible
If
I
had
told
you
my
ideas
the
very
first
time
you
saw
Mr
Alfred
that
astute
gentleman
would
your
so
expressive
a
rat
And
then
bon
jour
to
our
chances
of
catching
him
I
think
that
I
have
more
diplomacy
than
you
give
me
credit
for
My
friend
I
implore
you
do
not
enrage
yourself
Your
help
has
been
of
the
most
invaluable
It
is
but
the
extremely
beautiful
nature
that
you
have
which
made
me
pause
Well
I
grumbled
a
little
mollified
I
still
think
you
might
have
given
me
a
hint
But
I
did
my
friend
Several
hints
You
would
not
take
them
Think
now
did
I
ever
say
to
you
that
I
believed
John
Cavendish
guilty
Did
I
not
on
the
contrary
tell
you
that
he
would
almost
certainly
be
acquitted
Yes
but
And
did
I
not
immediately
afterwards
speak
of
the
difficulty
of
bringing
the
murderer
to
justice
Was
it
not
plain
to
you
that
I
was
speaking
of
two
entirely
different
persons
No
I
said
it
was
not
plain
to
me
Then
again
continued
at
the
beginning
did
I
not
repeat
to
you
several
times
that
I
didn't
want
Mr
arrested
now
That
should
have
conveyed
something
to
you
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
suspected
him
as
long
ago
as
that
Yes
To
begin
with
whoever
else
might
benefit
by
Mrs
death
her
husband
would
benefit
the
most
There
was
no
getting
away
from
that
When
I
went
up
to
Styles
with
you
that
first
day
I
had
no
idea
as
to
how
the
crime
had
been
committed
but
from
what
I
knew
of
Mr
I
fancied
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
find
anything
to
connect
him
with
it
When
I
arrived
at
the
chateau
I
realized
at
once
that
it
was
Mrs
who
had
burnt
the
will
and
there
by
the
way
you
cannot
complain
my
friend
for
I
tried
my
best
to
force
on
you
the
significance
of
that
bedroom
fire
in
midsummer
Yes
yes
I
said
impatiently
Go
on
Well
my
friend
as
I
say
my
views
as
to
Mr
guilt
were
very
much
shaken
There
was
in
fact
so
much
evidence
against
him
that
I
was
inclined
to
believe
that
he
had
not
done
it
When
did
you
change
your
mind
When
I
found
that
the
more
efforts
I
made
to
clear
him
the
more
efforts
he
made
to
get
himself
arrested
Then
when
I
discovered
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
Mrs
and
that
in
fact
it
was
John
Cavendish
who
was
interested
in
that
quarter
I
was
quite
sure
But
why
Simply
this
If
it
had
been
who
was
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
Mrs
his
silence
was
perfectly
comprehensible
But
when
I
discovered
that
it
was
known
all
over
the
village
that
it
was
John
who
was
attracted
by
the
farmer's
pretty
wife
his
silence
bore
quite
a
different
interpretation
It
was
nonsense
to
pretend
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
scandal
as
no
possible
scandal
could
attach
to
him
This
attitude
of
his
gave
me
furiously
to
think
and
I
was
slowly
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
Alfred
wanted
to
be
arrested
Eh
bien
from
that
moment
I
was
equally
determined
that
he
should
not
be
arrested
Wait
a
minute
I
don't
see
why
he
wished
to
be
arrested
Because
mon
ami
it
is
the
law
of
your
country
that
a
man
once
acquitted
can
never
be
tried
again
for
the
same
offence
Aha
but
it
was
idea
Assuredly
he
is
a
man
of
method
See
here
he
knew
that
in
his
position
he
was
bound
to
be
suspected
so
he
conceived
the
exceedingly
clever
idea
of
preparing
a
lot
of
manufactured
evidence
against
himself
He
wished
to
be
arrested
He
would
then
produce
his
irreproachable
hey
presto
he
was
safe
for
life
But
I
still
don't
see
how
he
managed
to
prove
his
alibi
and
yet
go
to
the
chemist's
shop
stared
at
me
in
surprise
Is
it
possible
My
poor
friend
You
have
not
yet
realized
that
it
was
Miss
who
went
to
the
chemist's
shop
Miss
But
certainly
Who
else
It
was
most
easy
for
her
She
is
of
a
good
height
her
voice
is
deep
and
manly
moreover
remember
she
and
are
cousins
and
there
is
a
distinct
resemblance
between
them
especially
in
their
gait
and
bearing
It
was
simplicity
itself
They
are
a
clever
pair
I
am
still
a
little
fogged
as
to
how
exactly
the
bromide
business
was
done
I
remarked
Bon
I
will
reconstruct
for
you
as
far
as
possible
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
Miss
was
the
master
mind
in
that
affair
You
remember
her
once
mentioning
that
her
father
was
a
doctor
Possibly
she
dispensed
his
medicines
for
him
or
she
may
have
taken
the
idea
from
one
of
the
many
books
lying
about
when
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
was
studying
for
her
exam
Anyway
she
was
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
addition
of
a
bromide
to
a
mixture
containing
strychnine
would
cause
the
precipitation
of
the
latter
Probably
the
idea
came
to
her
quite
suddenly
Mrs
had
a
box
of
bromide
powders
which
she
occasionally
took
at
night
What
could
be
easier
than
quietly
to
dissolve
one
or
more
of
those
powders
in
Mrs
large
sized
bottle
of
medicine
when
it
came
from
Coot's
The
risk
is
practically
nil
The
tragedy
will
not
take
place
until
nearly
a
fortnight
later
If
anyone
has
seen
either
of
them
touching
the
medicine
they
will
have
forgotten
it
by
that
time
Miss
will
have
engineered
her
quarrel
and
departed
from
the
house
The
lapse
of
time
and
her
absence
will
defeat
all
suspicion
Yes
it
was
a
clever
idea
If
they
had
left
it
alone
it
is
possible
the
crime
might
never
have
been
brought
home
to
them
But
they
were
not
satisfied
They
tried
to
be
too
that
was
their
undoing
puffed
at
his
tiny
cigarette
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
They
arranged
a
plan
to
throw
suspicion
on
John
Cavendish
by
buying
strychnine
at
the
village
chemist's
and
signing
the
register
in
his
hand-writing
On
Monday
Mrs
will
take
the
last
dose
of
her
medicine
On
Monday
therefore
at
six
o'clock
Alfred
arranges
to
be
seen
by
a
number
of
people
at
a
spot
far
removed
from
the
village
Miss
has
previously
made
up
a
cock
and
bull
story
about
him
and
Mrs
to
account
for
his
holding
his
tongue
afterwards
At
six
o'clock
Miss
disguised
as
Alfred
enters
the
chemist's
shop
with
her
story
about
a
dog
obtains
the
strychnine
and
writes
the
name
of
Alfred
in
John's
handwriting
which
she
had
previously
studied
carefully
But
as
it
will
never
do
if
John
too
can
prove
an
alibi
she
writes
him
an
anonymous
copying
his
takes
him
to
a
remote
spot
where
it
is
exceedingly
unlikely
that
anyone
will
see
him
So
far
all
goes
well
Miss
goes
back
to
Alfred
returns
to
Styles
There
is
nothing
that
can
compromise
him
in
any
way
since
it
is
Miss
who
has
the
strychnine
which
after
all
is
only
wanted
as
a
blind
to
throw
suspicion
on
John
now
a
hitch
occurs
Mrs
does
not
take
her
medicine
that
night
The
broken
bell
by
through
his
these
are
wasted
And
makes
his
slip
Mrs
is
out
and
he
sits
down
to
write
to
his
accomplice
who
he
fears
may
be
in
a
panic
at
the
of
their
plan
It
is
probable
that
Mrs
returned
earlier
than
he
expected
Caught
in
the
act
and
somewhat
he
hastily
shuts
and
locks
his
desk
He
fears
that
if
he
remains
in
the
room
he
may
have
to
open
it
again
and
that
Mrs
might
catch
sight
of
the
letter
before
he
could
snatch
it
up
So
he
goes
out
and
walks
in
the
woods
little
dreaming
that
Mrs
will
open
his
desk
and
discover
the
incriminating
document
But
this
as
we
know
is
what
happened
Mrs
reads
it
and
becomes
aware
of
the
perfidy
of
her
husband
and
though
unfortunately
the
sentence
about
the
bromides
conveys
no
warning
to
her
mind
She
knows
that
she
is
in
is
ignorant
of
where
the
danger
lies
She
decides
to
say
nothing
to
her
husband
but
sits
down
and
writes
to
her
solicitor
asking
him
to
come
on
the
morrow
and
she
also
determines
to
destroy
immediately
the
will
which
she
has
just
made
She
keeps
the
fatal
letter
It
was
to
discover
that
letter
then
that
her
husband
forced
the
lock
of
the
Yes
and
from
the
enormous
risk
he
ran
we
can
see
how
fully
he
realized
its
importance
That
letter
excepted
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
connect
him
with
the
crime
There's
only
one
thing
I
can't
make
out
why
didn't
he
destroy
it
at
once
when
he
got
hold
of
it
Because
he
did
not
dare
take
the
biggest
risk
of
of
keeping
it
on
his
own
person
I
don't
understand
Look
at
it
from
his
point
of
view
I
have
discovered
that
there
were
only
five
short
minutes
in
which
he
could
have
taken
five
minutes
immediately
before
our
own
arrival
on
the
scene
for
before
that
time
Annie
was
brushing
the
stairs
and
would
have
seen
anyone
who
passed
going
to
the
right
wing
Figure
to
yourself
the
scene
He
enters
the
room
unlocking
the
door
by
means
of
one
of
the
other
were
all
much
alike
He
hurries
to
the
is
locked
and
the
keys
are
nowhere
to
be
seen
That
is
a
terrible
blow
to
him
for
it
means
that
his
presence
in
the
room
cannot
be
concealed
as
he
had
hoped
But
he
sees
clearly
that
everything
must
be
risked
for
the
sake
of
that
damning
piece
of
evidence
Quickly
he
forces
the
lock
with
a
penknife
and
turns
over
the
papers
until
he
finds
what
he
is
looking
for
But
now
a
fresh
dilemma
arises
he
dare
not
keep
that
piece
of
paper
on
him
He
may
be
seen
leaving
the
may
be
searched
If
the
paper
is
found
on
him
it
is
certain
doom
Probably
at
this
minute
too
he
hears
the
sounds
below
of
Mr
Wells
and
John
leaving
the
boudoir
He
must
act
quickly
Where
can
he
hide
this
terrible
slip
of
paper
The
contents
of
the
are
kept
and
in
any
case
are
sure
to
be
examined
There
are
no
means
of
destroying
it
and
he
dare
not
keep
it
He
looks
round
and
he
do
you
think
mon
ami
I
shook
my
head
In
a
moment
he
has
torn
the
letter
into
long
thin
strips
and
rolling
them
up
into
spills
he
thrusts
them
hurriedly
in
amongst
the
other
spills
in
the
vase
on
the
mantle-piece
I
uttered
an
exclamation
No
one
would
think
of
looking
there
continued
And
he
will
be
able
at
his
leisure
to
come
back
and
destroy
this
solitary
piece
of
evidence
against
him
Then
all
the
time
it
was
in
the
spill
vase
in
Mrs
bedroom
under
our
very
noses
I
cried
nodded
Yes
my
friend
That
is
where
I
discovered
my
last
link
and
I
owe
that
very
fortunate
discovery
to
you
To
me
Yes
Do
you
remember
telling
me
that
my
hand
shook
as
I
was
straightening
the
ornaments
on
the
mantel-piece
Yes
but
I
don't
see
No
but
I
saw
Do
you
know
my
friend
I
remembered
that
earlier
in
the
morning
when
we
had
been
there
together
I
had
straightened
all
the
objects
on
the
mantel-piece
mantel-piece
And
if
they
were
already
straightened
there
would
be
no
need
to
straighten
them
again
unless
in
the
meantime
some
one
else
had
touched
them
Dear
me
I
murmured
so
that
is
the
explanation
of
your
extraordinary
behaviour
You
rushed
down
to
Styles
and
found
it
still
there
Yes
and
it
was
a
race
for
time
But
I
still
can't
understand
why
was
such
a
fool
as
to
leave
it
there
when
he
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
destroy
it
Ah
but
he
had
no
opportunity
I
saw
to
that
You
Yes
Do
you
remember
reproving
me
for
taking
the
household
into
my
confidence
on
the
subject
Yes
Well
my
friend
I
saw
there
was
just
one
chance
I
was
not
sure
then
if
was
the
criminal
or
not
but
if
he
was
I
reasoned
that
he
would
not
have
the
paper
on
him
but
would
have
hidden
it
somewhere
and
by
enlisting
the
sympathy
of
the
household
I
could
prevent
his
destroying
it
He
was
already
under
suspicion
and
by
making
the
matter
public
I
secured
the
services
of
about
ten
amateur
detectives
who
would
be
watching
him
unceasingly
and
being
himself
aware
of
their
watchfulness
he
would
not
dare
seek
further
to
destroy
the
document
He
was
therefore
forced
to
depart
from
the
house
leaving
it
in
the
spill
vase
But
surely
Miss
had
ample
opportunities
of
aiding
him
Yes
but
Miss
did
not
know
of
the
paper's
existence
In
accordance
with
their
prearranged
plan
she
never
spoke
to
Alfred
They
were
supposed
to
be
deadly
enemies
and
until
John
Cavendish
was
safely
convicted
they
neither
of
them
dared
risk
a
meeting
Of
course
I
had
a
watch
kept
on
Mr
hoping
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
lead
me
to
the
But
he
was
too
clever
to
take
any
chances
The
paper
was
safe
where
it
was
since
no
one
had
thought
of
looking
there
in
the
first
week
it
was
not
likely
they
would
do
so
afterwards
But
for
your
lucky
remark
we
might
never
have
been
able
to
bring
him
to
justice
I
understand
that
now
but
when
did
you
first
begin
to
suspect
Miss
When
I
discovered
that
she
had
told
a
lie
at
the
inquest
about
the
letter
she
had
received
from
Mrs
Why
what
was
there
to
lie
about
You
saw
that
letter
Do
you
recall
its
general
appearance
or
less
You
will
recollect
then
that
Mrs
wrote
a
very
distinctive
hand
and
left
large
clear
spaces
between
her
words
But
if
you
look
at
the
date
at
the
top
of
the
letter
you
will
notice
that
July
is
quite
different
in
this
respect
Do
you
see
what
I
mean
No
I
confessed
I
don't
You
do
not
see
that
that
letter
was
not
written
on
the
but
on
the
day
after
Miss
departure
The
was
written
in
before
the
to
turn
it
into
the
But
why
That
is
exactly
what
I
asked
myself
Why
does
Miss
suppress
the
letter
written
on
the
and
produce
this
faked
one
instead
Because
she
did
not
wish
to
show
the
letter
of
the
Why
again
And
at
once
a
suspicion
dawned
in
my
mind
You
will
remember
my
saying
that
it
was
wise
to
beware
of
people
who
were
not
telling
you
the
truth
And
yet
I
cried
indignantly
after
that
you
gave
me
two
reasons
why
Miss
could
not
have
committed
the
crime
And
very
good
reasons
too
replied
For
a
long
time
they
were
a
to
me
until
I
remembered
a
very
significant
fact
that
she
and
Alfred
were
cousins
She
could
not
have
committed
the
crime
but
the
reasons
against
that
did
not
her
from
being
an
accomplice
And
then
there
was
that
rather
hatred
of
hers
It
concealed
a
very
opposite
emotion
There
was
undoubtedly
a
tie
of
passion
between
them
long
before
he
came
to
Styles
They
had
already
arranged
their
infamous
he
should
marry
this
rich
but
rather
foolish
old
lady
induce
her
to
make
a
will
leaving
her
money
to
him
and
then
gain
their
ends
by
a
very
cleverly
conceived
crime
If
all
had
gone
as
they
planned
they
would
probably
have
left
England
and
lived
together
on
their
poor
victim's
money
They
are
a
very
astute
and
unscrupulous
pair
While
suspicion
was
to
be
directed
against
him
she
would
be
making
quiet
preparations
for
a
very
different
denouement
She
arrives
from
with
all
the
compromising
items
in
her
possession
No
suspicion
attaches
to
her
No
notice
is
paid
to
her
coming
and
going
in
the
house
She
hides
the
strychnine
and
glasses
in
John's
room
She
puts
the
beard
in
the
attic
She
will
see
to
it
that
sooner
or
later
they
are
duly
discovered
I
don't
quite
see
why
they
tried
to
fix
the
blame
on
John
I
remarked
It
would
have
been
much
easier
for
them
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
Lawrence
Yes
but
that
was
mere
chance
All
the
evidence
against
him
arose
out
of
pure
accident
It
must
in
fact
have
been
distinctly
annoying
to
the
pair
of
schemers
His
manner
was
unfortunate
I
observed
thoughtfully
Yes
You
realize
of
course
what
was
at
the
back
of
that
No
You
did
not
understand
that
he
believed
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
guilty
of
the
crime
No
I
exclaimed
astonished
Impossible
Not
at
all
I
myself
nearly
had
the
same
idea
It
was
in
my
mind
when
I
asked
Mr
Wells
that
first
question
about
the
will
Then
there
were
the
bromide
powders
which
she
had
made
up
and
her
clever
male
impersonations
as
Dorcas
recounted
them
to
us
There
was
really
more
evidence
against
her
than
anyone
else
You
are
joking
No
Shall
I
tell
you
what
made
Monsieur
Lawrence
turn
so
pale
when
he
first
entered
his
mother's
room
on
the
fatal
night
It
was
because
whilst
his
mother
lay
there
obviously
poisoned
he
saw
over
your
shoulder
that
the
door
into
Mademoiselle
room
was
But
he
declared
that
he
saw
it
bolted
I
cried
Exactly
said
And
that
was
just
what
confirmed
my
suspicion
that
it
was
not
He
was
shielding
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
But
why
should
he
shield
her
Because
he
is
in
love
with
her
I
laughed
There
you
are
quite
wrong
I
happen
to
know
for
a
fact
that
far
from
being
in
love
with
her
he
positively
dislikes
her
Who
told
you
that
mon
ami
Cynthia
herself
La
petite
And
she
was
concerned
She
said
that
she
did
not
mind
at
all
Then
she
certainly
did
mind
very
much
remarked
They
are
like
femmes
What
you
say
about
Lawrence
is
a
great
surprise
to
me
I
said
But
was
most
obvious
Did
not
Monsieur
Lawrence
make
the
sour
face
every
time
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
spoke
and
laughed
with
his
brother
He
had
taken
it
into
his
long
head
that
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
was
in
love
with
Monsieur
John
When
he
entered
his
mother's
room
and
saw
her
obviously
poisoned
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
knew
something
about
the
matter
He
was
nearly
driven
desperate
First
he
crushed
the
to
powder
under
his
feet
remembering
that
she
had
gone
up
with
his
mother
the
night
before
and
he
determined
that
there
should
be
no
chance
of
testing
its
contents
he
strenuously
and
quite
uselessly
upheld
the
theory
of
Death
from
natural
what
about
the
extra
I
was
fairly
certain
that
it
was
Mrs
Cavendish
who
had
hidden
it
but
I
had
to
make
sure
Monsieur
Lawrence
did
not
know
at
all
what
I
meant
but
on
reflection
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
could
find
an
extra
anywhere
his
lady
love
would
be
cleared
of
suspicion
And
he
was
perfectly
right
One
thing
more
What
did
Mrs
mean
by
her
dying
words
They
were
of
course
an
accusation
against
her
husband
Dear
me
I
said
with
a
sigh
I
think
you
have
explained
everything
I
am
glad
it
has
all
ended
so
happily
Even
John
and
his
wife
are
reconciled
Thanks
to
me
How
do
you
to
you
My
dear
friend
do
you
not
realize
that
it
was
simply
and
solely
the
trial
which
has
brought
them
together
again
That
John
Cavendish
still
loved
his
wife
I
was
convinced
Also
that
she
was
equally
in
love
with
him
But
they
had
drifted
very
far
apart
It
all
arose
from
a
misunderstanding
She
married
him
without
love
He
knew
it
He
is
a
sensitive
man
in
his
way
he
would
not
force
himself
upon
her
if
she
did
not
want
him
And
as
he
withdrew
her
love
awoke
But
they
are
both
unusually
proud
and
their
pride
held
them
inexorably
apart
He
drifted
into
an
entanglement
with
Mrs
and
she
deliberately
cultivated
the
friendship
of
Dr
Do
you
remember
the
day
of
John
arrest
when
you
found
me
deliberating
over
a
big
decision
Yes
I
quite
understood
your
distress
Pardon
me
mon
ami
but
you
did
not
understand
it
in
the
least
I
was
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
I
would
clear
John
Cavendish
at
once
I
could
have
cleared
it
might
have
meant
a
failure
to
convict
the
real
criminals
They
were
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
my
real
attitude
up
to
the
very
last
partly
accounts
for
my
success
Do
you
mean
that
you
could
have
saved
John
Cavendish
from
being
brought
to
trial
Yes
my
friend
But
I
eventually
decided
in
favour
of
a
woman's
happiness
Nothing
but
the
great
danger
through
which
they
have
passed
could
have
brought
these
two
proud
souls
together
again
I
looked
at
in
silent
amazement
The
colossal
cheek
of
the
little
man
Who
on
earth
but
would
have
thought
of
a
trial
for
murder
as
a
restorer
of
conjugal
happiness
I
perceive
your
thoughts
mon
ami
said
smiling
at
me
No
one
but
would
have
attempted
such
a
thing
And
you
are
wrong
in
condemning
it
The
happiness
of
one
man
and
one
woman
is
the
greatest
thing
in
all
the
world
His
words
took
me
back
to
earlier
events
I
remembered
Mary
as
she
lay
white
and
exhausted
on
the
sofa
listening
listening
There
had
come
the
sound
of
the
bell
below
She
had
started
up
had
opened
the
door
and
meeting
her
agonized
eyes
had
nodded
gently
Yes
madame
he
said
I
have
brought
him
back
to
you
He
had
stood
aside
and
as
I
went
out
I
had
seen
the
look
in
Mary's
eyes
as
John
Cavendish
had
caught
his
wife
in
his
arms
Perhaps
you
are
right
I
said
gently
Yes
it
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
Suddenly
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
Cynthia
peeped
in
II
only
Come
in
I
said
springing
up
She
came
in
but
did
not
sit
down
wanted
to
tell
you
something
Yes
Cynthia
with
a
little
tassel
for
some
moments
then
suddenly
exclaiming
You
dears
kissed
first
me
and
then
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
again
What
on
earth
does
this
mean
I
asked
surprised
It
was
very
nice
to
be
kissed
by
Cynthia
but
the
publicity
of
the
salute
rather
impaired
the
pleasure
It
means
that
she
has
discovered
Monsieur
Lawrence
does
not
dislike
her
as
much
as
she
thought
replied
philosophically
But
Here
he
is
Lawrence
at
that
moment
passed
the
door
Eh
Monsieur
Lawrence
called
We
must
congratulate
you
is
it
not
so
Lawrence
blushed
and
then
smiled
awkwardly
A
man
in
love
is
a
sorry
spectacle
Now
Cynthia
had
looked
charming
I
sighed
What
is
it
mon
ami
Nothing
I
said
sadly
They
are
two
delightful
women
And
neither
of
them
is
for
you
finished
Never
mind
Console
yourself
my
friend
We
may
hunt
together
again
who
knows
