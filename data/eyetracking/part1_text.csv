The
intense
interest
aroused
in
the
public
by
what
was
known
at
the
time
as
The
Styles
Case
has
now
somewhat
subsided
Nevertheless
in
view
of
the
worldwide
notoriety
which
attended
it
I
have
been
asked
both
by
my
friend
and
the
family
themselves
to
write
an
account
of
the
whole
story
This
we
trust
will
silence
the
sensational
rumours
which
still
persist
I
will
therefore
briefly
set
down
the
circumstances
which
led
to
my
being
connected
with
the
affair
I
had
been
invalided
home
from
the
Front
and
after
spending
some
months
in
a
rather
depressing
Convalescent
Home
was
given
a
months
sick
leave
Having
no
near
relations
or
friends
I
was
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
when
I
ran
across
John
Cavendish
I
had
seen
very
little
of
him
for
some
years
Indeed
I
had
never
known
him
particularly
well
He
was
a
good
fifteen
years
my
senior
for
one
thing
though
he
hardly
looked
his
years
As
a
boy
though
I
had
often
stayed
at
Styles
his
mothers
place
in
We
had
a
good
yarn
about
old
times
and
it
ended
in
his
inviting
me
down
to
Styles
to
spend
my
leave
there
The
mater
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
all
those
years
he
added
Your
mother
keeps
well
I
asked
Oh
yes
I
suppose
you
know
that
she
has
married
again
I
am
afraid
I
showed
my
surprise
rather
plainly
Mrs
Cavendish
who
had
married
Johns
father
when
he
was
a
widower
with
two
sons
had
been
a
handsome
woman
of
as
I
remembered
her
She
certainly
could
not
be
a
day
less
than
seventy
now
I
recalled
her
as
an
energetic
autocratic
personality
somewhat
inclined
to
charitable
and
social
notoriety
with
a
fondness
for
opening
bazaars
and
playing
the
Lady
Bountiful
She
was
a
most
generous
woman
and
possessed
a
considerable
fortune
of
her
own
Their
Styles
Court
had
been
purchased
by
Mr
Cavendish
early
in
their
married
life
He
had
been
completely
under
his
wifes
ascendancy
so
much
so
that
on
dying
he
left
the
place
to
her
for
her
lifetime
as
well
as
the
larger
part
of
his
income
an
arrangement
that
was
distinctly
unfair
to
his
two
sons
Their
stepmother
however
had
always
been
most
generous
to
them
indeed
they
were
so
young
at
the
time
of
their
fathers
remarriage
that
they
always
thought
of
her
as
their
own
mother
Lawrence
the
younger
had
been
a
delicate
youth
He
had
qualified
as
a
doctor
but
early
relinquished
the
profession
of
medicine
and
lived
at
home
while
pursuing
literary
ambitions
though
his
verses
never
had
any
marked
success
John
practiced
for
some
time
as
a
barrister
but
had
finally
settled
down
to
the
more
congenial
life
of
a
country
squire
He
had
married
two
years
ago
and
had
taken
his
wife
to
live
at
Styles
though
I
entertained
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
he
would
have
preferred
his
mother
to
increase
his
allowance
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
have
a
home
of
his
own
Mrs
Cavendish
however
was
a
lady
who
liked
to
make
her
own
plans
and
expected
other
people
to
fall
in
with
them
and
in
this
case
she
certainly
had
the
whip
hand
namely
the
purse
strings
John
noticed
my
surprise
at
the
news
of
his
mothers
remarriage
and
smiled
rather
Rotten
little
bounder
too
he
said
savagely
I
can
tell
you
Hastings
its
making
life
jolly
difficult
for
us
As
for
remember
No
Oh
I
suppose
she
was
after
your
time
Shes
the
factotum
companion
Jack
of
all
trades
A
great
Not
precisely
young
and
beautiful
but
as
game
as
they
make
them
You
were
going
to
say
Oh
this
fellow
He
turned
up
from
nowhere
on
the
pretext
of
being
a
second
cousin
or
something
of
though
she
didnt
seem
particularly
keen
to
acknowledge
the
relationship
The
fellow
is
an
absolute
outsider
anyone
can
see
that
Hes
got
a
great
black
beard
and
wears
patent
leather
boots
in
all
weathers
But
the
mater
cottoned
to
him
at
once
took
him
on
as
know
how
shes
always
running
a
hundred
societies
I
nodded
Well
of
course
the
war
has
turned
the
hundreds
into
thousands
No
doubt
the
fellow
was
very
useful
to
her
But
you
could
have
knocked
us
all
down
with
a
feather
when
three
months
ago
she
suddenly
announced
that
she
and
Alfred
were
engaged
The
fellow
must
be
at
least
twenty
years
younger
than
she
is
Its
simply
barefaced
fortune
hunting
but
there
you
is
her
own
mistress
and
shes
married
him
It
must
be
a
difficult
situation
for
you
all
Difficult
Its
damnable
Thus
it
came
about
that
three
days
later
I
descended
from
the
train
at
Styles
St
Mary
an
absurd
little
station
with
no
apparent
reason
for
existence
perched
up
in
the
midst
of
green
fields
and
country
lanes
John
Cavendish
was
waiting
on
the
platform
and
piloted
me
out
to
the
car
Got
a
drop
or
two
of
petrol
still
you
see
he
remarked
Mainly
owing
to
the
activities
The
village
of
Styles
St
Mary
was
situated
about
two
miles
from
the
little
station
and
Styles
Court
lay
a
mile
the
other
side
of
it
It
was
a
still
warm
day
in
early
July
As
one
looked
out
over
the
flat
country
lying
so
green
and
peaceful
under
the
afternoon
sun
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
not
so
very
far
away
a
great
war
was
running
its
appointed
course
I
felt
I
had
suddenly
strayed
into
another
world
As
we
turned
in
at
the
lodge
gates
John
said
Im
afraid
find
it
very
quiet
down
here
Hastings
My
dear
fellow
thats
just
what
I
want
Oh
its
pleasant
enough
if
you
want
to
lead
the
idle
life
I
drill
with
the
volunteers
twice
a
week
and
lend
a
hand
at
the
farms
My
wife
works
regularly
on
the
land
She
is
up
at
five
every
morning
to
milk
and
keeps
at
it
steadily
until
lunchtime
Its
a
jolly
good
life
taking
it
all
it
werent
for
that
fellow
Alfred
He
checked
the
car
suddenly
and
glanced
at
his
watch
I
wonder
if
weve
time
to
pick
up
Cynthia
No
shell
have
started
from
the
hospital
by
now
Cynthia
Thats
not
your
wife
No
Cynthia
is
a
protegee
of
my
mothers
the
daughter
of
an
old
of
hers
who
married
a
rascally
solicitor
He
came
a
cropper
and
the
girl
was
left
an
orphan
and
penniless
My
mother
came
to
the
rescue
and
Cynthia
has
been
with
us
nearly
two
years
now
She
works
in
the
Red
Cross
Hospital
at
seven
miles
away
As
he
spoke
the
last
words
we
drew
up
in
front
of
the
fine
old
house
A
lady
in
a
stout
tweed
skirt
who
was
bending
over
a
flower
bed
straightened
herself
at
our
approach
Hullo
heres
our
wounded
hero
Mr
Miss
shook
hands
with
a
hearty
almost
painful
grip
I
had
an
impression
of
very
blue
eyes
in
a
sunburnt
face
She
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
with
a
deep
voice
almost
manly
in
its
tones
and
had
a
large
sensible
square
body
with
feet
to
last
encased
in
good
thick
boots
Her
conversation
I
soon
found
was
couched
in
the
telegraphic
style
Weeds
grow
like
house
afire
Cant
keep
even
with
em
Shall
press
you
in
Better
be
careful
Im
sure
I
shall
be
only
too
delighted
to
make
myself
useful
I
responded
Dont
say
it
Never
does
Wish
you
hadnt
later
Youre
a
cynic
said
John
laughing
Wheres
tea
or
out
Out
Too
fine
a
day
to
be
cooped
up
in
the
house
Come
on
then
youve
done
enough
gardening
for
today
The
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
you
know
Come
and
be
refreshed
Well
said
Miss
drawing
off
her
gardening
gloves
Im
inclined
to
agree
with
you
She
led
the
way
round
the
house
to
where
tea
was
spread
under
the
shade
of
a
large
sycamore
A
figure
rose
from
one
of
the
basket
chairs
and
came
a
few
steps
to
meet
us
My
wife
Hastings
said
John
I
shall
never
forget
my
first
sight
of
Mary
Cavendish
Her
tall
slender
form
outlined
against
the
bright
light
the
vivid
sense
of
slumbering
fire
that
seemed
to
find
expression
only
in
those
wonderful
tawny
eyes
of
hers
remarkable
eyes
different
from
any
other
womans
that
I
have
ever
known
the
intense
power
of
stillness
she
possessed
which
nevertheless
conveyed
the
impression
of
a
wild
untamed
spirit
in
an
exquisitely
civilised
these
things
are
burnt
into
my
memory
I
shall
never
forget
them
She
greeted
me
with
a
few
words
of
pleasant
welcome
in
a
low
clear
voice
and
I
sank
into
a
basket
chair
feeling
distinctly
glad
that
I
had
accepted
Johns
invitation
Mrs
Cavendish
gave
me
some
tea
and
her
few
quiet
remarks
heightened
my
first
impression
of
her
as
a
thoroughly
fascinating
woman
An
appreciative
listener
is
always
stimulating
and
I
described
in
a
humorous
manner
certain
incidents
of
my
Convalescent
Home
in
a
way
which
I
flatter
myself
greatly
amused
my
hostess
John
of
course
good
fellow
though
he
is
could
hardly
be
called
a
brilliant
conversationalist
At
that
moment
a
well
remembered
voice
floated
through
the
open
French
window
near
at
hand
Then
write
to
the
Princess
after
tea
Alfred
Ill
write
to
Lady
for
the
second
day
myself
Or
shall
we
wait
until
we
hear
from
the
Princess
In
case
of
a
refusal
Lady
might
open
it
the
first
day
and
Mrs
the
second
Then
theres
the
the
school
fete
There
was
the
murmur
of
a
mans
voice
and
then
Mrs
rose
in
reply
Yes
certainly
After
tea
will
do
quite
well
You
are
so
thoughtful
Alfred
dear
The
French
window
swung
open
a
little
wider
and
a
handsome
old
lady
with
a
somewhat
masterful
cast
of
features
stepped
out
of
it
on
to
the
lawn
A
man
followed
her
a
suggestion
of
deference
in
his
manner
Mrs
greeted
me
with
effusion
Why
if
it
isnt
too
delightful
to
see
you
again
Mr
Hastings
after
all
these
years
Alfred
darling
Mr
husband
I
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
Alfred
darling
He
certainly
struck
a
rather
alien
note
I
did
not
wonder
at
John
objecting
to
his
beard
It
was
one
of
the
longest
and
blackest
I
have
ever
seen
He
wore
and
had
a
curious
of
feature
It
struck
me
that
he
might
look
natural
on
a
stage
but
was
strangely
out
of
place
in
real
life
His
voice
was
rather
deep
and
unctuous
He
placed
a
wooden
hand
in
mine
and
said
This
is
a
pleasure
Mr
Hastings
Then
turning
to
his
wife
Emily
dearest
I
think
that
cushion
is
a
little
damp
She
beamed
fondly
on
him
as
he
substituted
another
with
every
demonstration
of
the
tenderest
care
Strange
infatuation
of
an
otherwise
sensible
woman
With
the
presence
of
Mr
a
sense
of
constraint
and
veiled
hostility
seemed
to
settle
down
upon
the
company
Miss
in
particular
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
feelings
Mrs
however
seemed
to
notice
nothing
unusual
Her
volubility
which
I
remembered
of
old
had
lost
nothing
in
the
intervening
years
and
she
poured
out
a
steady
flood
of
conversation
mainly
on
the
subject
of
the
forthcoming
bazaar
which
she
was
organizing
and
which
was
to
take
place
shortly
Occasionally
she
referred
to
her
husband
over
a
question
of
days
or
dates
His
watchful
and
attentive
manner
never
varied
From
the
very
first
I
took
a
firm
and
rooted
dislike
to
him
and
I
flatter
myself
that
my
first
judgments
are
usually
fairly
shrewd
Presently
Mrs
turned
to
give
some
instructions
about
letters
to
and
her
husband
addressed
me
in
his
painstaking
voice
Is
soldiering
your
regular
profession
Mr
Hastings
No
before
the
war
I
was
in
And
you
will
return
there
after
it
is
over
Perhaps
Either
that
or
a
fresh
start
altogether
Mary
Cavendish
leant
forward
What
would
you
really
choose
as
a
profession
if
you
could
just
consult
your
inclination
Well
that
depends
No
secret
hobby
she
asked
Tell
drawn
to
something
Every
one
something
absurd
laugh
at
me
She
smiled
Perhaps
Well
Ive
always
had
a
secret
hankering
to
be
a
detective
The
real
Yard
Or
Sherlock
Holmes
Oh
Sherlock
Holmes
by
all
means
But
really
seriously
I
am
awfully
drawn
to
it
I
came
across
a
man
in
Belgium
once
a
very
famous
detective
and
he
quite
inflamed
me
He
was
a
marvellous
little
fellow
He
used
to
say
that
all
good
detective
work
was
a
mere
matter
of
method
My
system
is
based
on
of
course
I
have
progressed
rather
further
He
was
a
funny
little
man
a
great
dandy
but
wonderfully
clever
Like
a
good
detective
story
myself
remarked
Miss
Lots
of
nonsense
written
though
Criminal
discovered
in
last
chapter
Every
one
dumbfounded
Real
know
at
once
There
have
been
a
great
number
of
undiscovered
crimes
I
argued
Dont
mean
the
police
but
the
people
that
are
right
in
it
The
family
You
couldnt
really
hoodwink
them
Theyd
know
Then
I
said
much
amused
you
think
that
if
you
were
mixed
up
in
a
crime
say
a
murder
youd
be
able
to
spot
the
murderer
right
off
Of
course
I
should
be
able
to
prove
it
to
a
pack
of
lawyers
But
Im
certain
Id
know
Id
feel
it
in
my
fingertips
if
he
came
near
me
It
might
be
a
she
I
suggested
Might
But
murders
a
violent
crime
Associate
it
more
with
a
man
Not
in
a
case
of
poisoning
Mrs
clear
voice
startled
me
Dr
was
saying
yesterday
that
owing
to
the
general
ignorance
of
the
more
uncommon
poisons
among
the
medical
profession
there
were
probably
countless
cases
of
poisoning
quite
unsuspected
Why
Mary
what
a
gruesome
conversation
cried
Mrs
It
makes
me
feel
as
if
a
goose
were
walking
over
my
grave
Oh
theres
Cynthia
A
young
girl
in
V
A
D
uniform
ran
lightly
across
the
lawn
Why
Cynthia
you
are
late
today
This
is
Mr
Cynthia
was
a
young
creature
full
of
life
and
vigour
She
tossed
off
her
little
V
A
D
cap
and
I
admired
the
great
loose
waves
of
her
auburn
hair
and
the
smallness
and
whiteness
of
the
hand
she
held
out
to
claim
her
tea
With
dark
eyes
and
eyelashes
she
would
have
been
a
beauty
She
flung
herself
down
on
the
ground
beside
John
and
as
I
handed
her
a
plate
of
sandwiches
she
smiled
up
at
me
Sit
down
here
on
the
grass
do
Its
ever
so
much
nicer
I
dropped
down
obediently
You
work
at
dont
you
Miss
She
nodded
For
my
sins
Do
they
bully
you
then
I
asked
smiling
I
should
like
to
see
them
cried
Cynthia
with
dignity
I
have
got
a
cousin
who
is
nursing
I
remarked
And
she
is
terrified
of
Sisters
I
dont
wonder
Sisters
are
you
know
Mr
Hastings
They
simply
are
Youve
no
idea
But
Im
not
a
nurse
thank
heaven
I
work
in
the
dispensary
How
many
people
do
you
poison
I
asked
smiling
Cynthia
smiled
too
Oh
hundreds
she
said
Cynthia
called
Mrs
do
you
think
you
could
write
a
few
notes
for
me
Certainly
Aunt
Emily
She
jumped
up
promptly
and
something
in
her
manner
reminded
me
that
her
position
was
a
dependent
one
and
that
Mrs
kind
as
she
might
be
in
the
main
did
not
allow
her
to
forget
it
My
hostess
turned
to
me
John
will
show
you
your
room
Supper
is
at
seven
We
have
given
up
late
dinner
for
some
time
now
Lady
our
Members
was
the
late
Lord
the
same
She
agrees
with
me
that
one
must
set
an
example
of
economy
We
are
quite
a
war
household
nothing
is
wasted
scrap
of
waste
paper
even
is
saved
and
sent
away
in
sacks
I
expressed
my
appreciation
and
John
took
me
into
the
house
and
up
the
broad
staircase
which
forked
right
and
left
halfway
to
different
wings
of
the
building
My
room
was
in
the
left
wing
and
looked
out
over
the
park
John
left
me
and
a
few
minutes
later
I
saw
him
from
my
window
walking
slowly
across
the
grass
arm
in
arm
with
Cynthia
I
heard
Mrs
call
Cynthia
impatiently
and
the
girl
started
and
ran
back
to
the
house
At
the
same
moment
a
man
stepped
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
and
walked
slowly
in
the
same
direction
He
looked
about
forty
very
dark
with
a
melancholy
face
Some
violent
emotion
seemed
to
be
mastering
him
He
looked
up
at
my
window
as
he
passed
and
I
recognized
him
though
he
had
changed
much
in
the
fifteen
years
that
had
elapsed
since
we
last
met
It
was
Johns
younger
brother
Lawrence
Cavendish
I
wondered
what
it
was
that
had
brought
that
singular
expression
to
his
face
Then
I
dismissed
him
from
my
mind
and
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
my
own
affairs
The
evening
passed
pleasantly
enough
and
I
dreamed
that
night
of
that
enigmatical
woman
Mary
Cavendish
The
next
morning
dawned
bright
and
sunny
and
I
was
full
of
the
anticipation
of
a
delightful
visit
I
did
not
see
Mrs
Cavendish
until
lunchtime
when
she
volunteered
to
take
me
for
a
walk
and
we
spent
a
charming
afternoon
roaming
in
the
woods
returning
to
the
house
about
five
As
we
entered
the
large
hall
John
beckoned
us
both
into
the
I
saw
at
once
by
his
face
that
something
disturbing
had
occurred
We
followed
him
in
and
he
shut
the
door
after
us
Look
here
Mary
theres
the
deuce
of
a
mess
had
a
row
with
Alfred
and
shes
off
Off
John
nodded
Yes
you
see
she
went
to
the
mater
herself
Miss
entered
Her
lips
were
set
grimly
together
and
she
carried
a
small
suitcase
She
looked
excited
and
determined
and
slightly
on
the
defensive
At
any
rate
she
burst
out
Ive
spoken
my
mind
My
dear
cried
Mrs
Cavendish
this
cant
be
true
Miss
nodded
grimly
True
enough
Afraid
I
said
some
things
to
Emily
she
wont
forget
or
forgive
in
a
hurry
Dont
mind
if
theyve
only
sunk
in
a
bit
Probably
water
off
a
ducks
back
though
I
said
right
out
Youre
an
old
woman
Emily
and
theres
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
The
mans
twenty
years
younger
than
you
and
dont
you
fool
yourself
as
to
what
he
married
you
for
Money
Well
dont
let
him
have
too
much
of
it
Farmer
has
got
a
very
pretty
young
wife
Just
ask
your
Alfred
how
much
time
he
spends
over
there
She
was
very
angry
Natural
I
went
on
Im
going
to
warn
you
whether
you
like
it
or
not
That
man
would
as
soon
murder
you
in
your
bed
as
look
at
you
Hes
a
bad
lot
You
can
say
what
you
like
to
me
but
remember
what
Ive
told
you
Hes
a
bad
lot
What
did
she
say
Miss
made
an
extremely
expressive
Darling
wicked
accuse
her
dear
husband
The
sooner
I
left
her
house
the
better
So
Im
off
But
not
now
This
minute
For
a
moment
we
sat
and
stared
at
her
Finally
John
Cavendish
finding
his
persuasions
of
no
avail
went
off
to
look
up
the
trains
His
wife
followed
him
murmuring
something
about
persuading
Mrs
to
think
better
of
it
As
she
left
the
room
Miss
face
changed
She
leant
towards
me
eagerly
Mr
Hastings
youre
honest
I
can
trust
you
I
was
a
little
startled
She
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
and
sank
her
voice
to
a
whisper
Look
after
her
Mr
Hastings
My
poor
Emily
Theyre
a
lot
of
them
Oh
I
know
what
Im
talking
about
There
isnt
one
of
them
thats
not
hard
up
and
trying
to
get
money
out
of
her
Ive
protected
her
as
much
as
I
could
Now
Im
out
of
the
way
theyll
impose
upon
her
Of
course
Miss
I
said
Ill
do
everything
I
can
but
Im
sure
youre
excited
and
overwrought
She
interrupted
me
by
slowly
shaking
her
forefinger
Young
man
trust
me
Ive
lived
in
the
world
rather
longer
than
you
have
All
I
ask
you
is
to
keep
your
eyes
open
see
what
I
mean
The
throb
of
the
motor
came
through
the
open
window
and
Miss
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
Johns
voice
sounded
outside
With
her
hand
on
the
handle
she
turned
her
head
over
her
shoulder
and
beckoned
to
me
Above
all
Mr
Hastings
watch
that
husband
There
was
no
time
for
more
Miss
was
swallowed
up
in
an
eager
chorus
of
protests
and
goodbyes
The
did
not
appear
As
the
motor
drove
away
Mrs
Cavendish
suddenly
detached
herself
from
the
group
and
moved
across
the
drive
to
the
lawn
to
meet
a
tall
bearded
man
who
had
been
evidently
making
for
the
house
The
colour
rose
in
her
cheeks
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
Who
is
that
I
asked
sharply
for
instinctively
I
distrusted
the
man
Thats
Dr
said
John
shortly
And
who
is
Dr
Hes
staying
in
the
village
doing
a
rest
cure
after
a
bad
nervous
breakdown
Hes
a
London
specialist
a
very
clever
of
the
greatest
living
experts
on
poisons
I
believe
And
hes
a
great
friend
of
Marys
put
in
Cynthia
the
irrepressible
John
Cavendish
frowned
and
changed
the
subject
Come
for
a
stroll
Hastings
This
has
been
a
most
rotten
business
She
always
had
a
rough
tongue
but
there
is
no
friend
in
England
than
He
took
the
path
through
the
plantation
and
we
walked
down
to
the
village
through
the
woods
which
bordered
one
side
of
the
estate
As
we
passed
through
one
of
the
gates
on
our
way
home
again
a
pretty
young
woman
of
gipsy
type
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
bowed
and
smiled
Thats
a
pretty
girl
I
remarked
appreciatively
Johns
face
hardened
That
is
Mrs
The
one
that
Miss
Exactly
said
John
with
rather
unnecessary
abruptness
I
thought
of
the
old
lady
in
the
big
house
and
that
vivid
wicked
little
face
that
had
just
smiled
into
ours
and
a
vague
chill
of
foreboding
crept
over
me
I
brushed
it
aside
Styles
is
really
a
glorious
old
place
I
said
to
John
He
nodded
rather
Yes
its
a
fine
property
Itll
be
mine
some
be
mine
now
by
rights
if
my
father
had
only
made
a
decent
will
And
then
I
shouldnt
be
so
damned
hard
up
as
I
am
now
Hard
up
are
you
My
dear
Hastings
I
dont
mind
telling
you
that
Im
at
my
wits
end
for
money
Couldnt
your
brother
help
you
Lawrence
Hes
gone
through
every
penny
he
ever
had
publishing
rotten
verses
in
fancy
bindings
No
were
an
impecunious
lot
My
mothers
always
been
awfully
good
to
us
I
must
say
That
is
up
to
now
Since
her
marriage
of
course
he
broke
off
frowning
For
the
first
time
I
felt
that
with
something
indefinable
had
gone
from
the
atmosphere
Her
presence
had
spelt
security
Now
that
security
was
the
air
seemed
rife
with
suspicion
The
sinister
face
of
Dr
to
me
unpleasantly
A
vague
suspicion
of
every
one
and
everything
filled
my
mind
Just
for
a
moment
I
had
a
premonition
of
approaching
evil
I
had
arrived
at
Styles
on
the
of
July
I
come
now
to
the
events
of
the
and
of
that
month
For
the
convenience
of
the
reader
I
will
recapitulate
the
incidents
of
those
days
in
as
exact
a
manner
as
possible
They
were
elicited
subsequently
at
the
trial
by
a
process
of
long
and
tedious
I
received
a
letter
from
a
couple
of
days
after
her
departure
telling
me
she
was
working
as
a
nurse
at
the
big
hospital
in
a
manufacturing
town
some
fifteen
miles
away
and
begging
me
to
let
her
know
if
Mrs
should
show
any
wish
to
be
reconciled
The
only
fly
in
the
ointment
of
my
peaceful
days
was
Mrs
extraordinary
and
for
my
part
unaccountable
preference
for
the
society
of
Dr
What
she
saw
in
the
man
I
cannot
imagine
but
she
was
always
asking
him
up
to
the
house
and
often
went
off
for
long
expeditions
with
him
I
must
confess
that
I
was
quite
unable
to
see
his
attraction
The
of
July
fell
on
a
Monday
It
was
a
day
of
turmoil
The
famous
bazaar
had
taken
place
on
Saturday
and
an
entertainment
in
connection
with
the
same
charity
at
which
Mrs
was
to
recite
a
War
poem
was
to
be
held
that
night
We
were
all
busy
during
the
morning
arranging
and
decorating
the
Hall
in
the
village
where
it
was
to
take
place
We
had
a
late
luncheon
and
spent
the
afternoon
resting
in
the
garden
I
noticed
that
Johns
manner
was
somewhat
unusual
He
seemed
very
excited
and
restless
After
tea
Mrs
went
to
lie
down
to
rest
before
her
efforts
in
the
evening
and
I
challenged
Mary
Cavendish
to
a
single
at
tennis
About
a
quarter
to
seven
Mrs
called
us
that
we
should
be
late
as
supper
was
early
that
night
We
had
rather
a
scramble
to
get
ready
in
time
and
before
the
meal
was
over
the
motor
was
waiting
at
the
door
The
entertainment
was
a
great
success
Mrs
recitation
receiving
tremendous
applause
There
were
also
some
tableaux
in
which
Cynthia
took
part
She
did
not
return
with
us
having
been
asked
to
a
supper
party
and
to
remain
the
night
with
some
friends
who
had
been
acting
with
her
in
the
tableaux
The
following
morning
Mrs
stayed
in
bed
to
breakfast
as
she
was
rather
overtired
but
she
appeared
in
her
mood
about
and
swept
Lawrence
and
myself
off
to
a
luncheon
party
Such
a
charming
invitation
from
Mrs
Lady
sister
you
know
The
came
over
with
the
of
our
oldest
families
Mary
had
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
an
engagement
with
Dr
We
had
a
pleasant
luncheon
and
as
we
drove
away
Lawrence
suggested
that
we
should
return
by
which
was
barely
a
mile
out
of
our
way
and
pay
a
visit
to
Cynthia
in
her
dispensary
Mrs
replied
that
this
was
an
excellent
idea
but
as
she
had
several
letters
to
write
she
would
drop
us
there
and
we
could
come
back
with
Cynthia
in
the
We
were
detained
under
suspicion
by
the
hospital
porter
until
Cynthia
appeared
to
vouch
for
us
looking
very
cool
and
sweet
in
her
long
white
overall
She
took
us
up
to
her
sanctum
and
introduced
us
to
her
fellow
dispenser
a
rather
individual
whom
Cynthia
cheerily
addressed
as
Nibs
What
a
lot
of
bottles
I
exclaimed
as
my
eye
travelled
round
the
small
room
Do
you
really
know
whats
in
them
all
Say
something
original
groaned
Cynthia
Every
single
person
who
comes
up
here
says
that
We
are
really
thinking
of
bestowing
a
prize
on
the
first
individual
who
does
not
say
What
a
lot
of
bottles
And
I
know
the
next
thing
youre
going
to
say
is
How
many
people
have
you
poisoned
I
pleaded
guilty
with
a
laugh
If
you
people
only
knew
how
fatally
easy
it
is
to
poison
some
one
by
mistake
you
wouldnt
joke
about
it
Come
on
lets
have
tea
Weve
got
all
sorts
of
secret
stories
in
that
cupboard
No
the
poison
cupboard
The
big
right
We
had
a
very
cheery
tea
and
assisted
Cynthia
to
wash
up
afterwards
We
had
just
put
away
the
last
teaspoon
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
The
of
Cynthia
and
Nibs
were
suddenly
petrified
into
a
stern
and
forbidding
expression
Come
in
said
Cynthia
in
a
sharp
professional
tone
A
young
and
rather
scared
looking
nurse
appeared
with
a
bottle
which
she
proffered
to
Nibs
who
waved
her
towards
Cynthia
with
the
somewhat
enigmatical
remark
Im
not
really
here
today
Cynthia
took
the
bottle
and
examined
it
with
the
severity
of
a
judge
This
should
have
been
sent
up
this
morning
Sister
is
very
sorry
She
forgot
Sister
should
read
the
rules
outside
the
door
I
gathered
from
the
little
nurses
expression
that
there
was
not
the
least
likelihood
of
her
having
the
to
retail
this
message
to
the
dreaded
Sister
So
now
it
cant
be
done
until
tomorrow
finished
Cynthia
Dont
you
think
you
could
possibly
let
us
have
it
tonight
Well
said
Cynthia
graciously
we
are
very
busy
but
if
we
have
time
it
shall
be
done
The
little
nurse
withdrew
and
Cynthia
promptly
took
a
jar
from
the
shelf
refilled
the
bottle
and
placed
it
on
the
table
outside
the
door
I
laughed
Discipline
must
be
maintained
Exactly
Come
out
on
our
little
balcony
You
can
see
all
the
outside
wards
there
I
followed
Cynthia
and
her
friend
and
they
pointed
out
the
different
wards
to
me
Lawrence
remained
behind
but
after
a
few
moments
Cynthia
called
to
him
over
her
shoulder
to
come
and
join
us
Then
she
looked
at
her
watch
Nothing
more
to
do
Nibs
No
All
right
Then
we
can
lock
up
and
go
I
had
seen
Lawrence
in
quite
a
different
light
that
afternoon
Compared
to
John
he
was
an
astoundingly
difficult
person
to
get
to
know
He
was
the
opposite
of
his
brother
in
almost
every
respect
being
unusually
shy
and
reserved
Yet
he
had
a
certain
charm
of
manner
and
I
fancied
that
if
one
really
knew
him
well
one
could
have
a
deep
affection
for
him
I
had
always
fancied
that
his
manner
to
Cynthia
was
rather
constrained
and
that
she
on
her
side
was
inclined
to
be
shy
of
him
But
they
were
both
gay
enough
this
afternoon
and
chatted
together
like
a
couple
of
children
As
we
drove
through
the
village
I
remembered
that
I
wanted
some
stamps
so
accordingly
we
pulled
up
at
the
post
office
As
I
came
out
again
I
into
a
little
man
who
was
just
entering
I
drew
aside
and
apologised
when
suddenly
with
a
loud
exclamation
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
warmly
Mon
ami
Hastings
he
cried
It
is
indeed
mon
ami
Hastings
I
exclaimed
I
turned
to
the
This
is
a
very
pleasant
meeting
for
me
Miss
Cynthia
This
is
my
old
friend
Monsieur
whom
I
have
not
seen
for
years
Oh
we
know
Monsieur
said
Cynthia
gaily
But
I
had
no
idea
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
Yes
indeed
said
seriously
I
know
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
It
is
by
the
charity
of
that
good
Mrs
that
I
am
here
Then
as
I
looked
at
him
Yes
my
friend
she
had
kindly
extended
hospitality
to
seven
of
my
who
alas
are
refugees
from
their
native
land
We
Belgians
will
always
remember
her
with
gratitude
was
an
extraordinary
looking
little
man
He
was
hardly
more
than
five
feet
four
inches
but
carried
himself
with
great
dignity
His
head
was
exactly
the
shape
of
an
egg
and
he
always
perched
it
a
little
on
one
side
His
moustache
was
very
stiff
and
military
The
neatness
of
his
attire
was
almost
incredible
I
believe
a
speck
of
dust
would
have
caused
him
more
pain
than
a
bullet
wound
Yet
this
quaint
little
man
who
I
was
sorry
to
see
now
limped
badly
had
been
in
his
time
one
of
the
most
celebrated
members
of
the
Belgian
police
As
a
detective
his
flair
had
been
extraordinary
and
he
had
achieved
triumphs
by
unravelling
some
of
the
most
baffling
cases
of
the
day
He
pointed
out
to
me
the
little
house
inhabited
by
him
and
his
fellow
Belgians
and
I
promised
to
go
and
see
him
at
an
early
date
Then
he
raised
his
hat
with
a
flourish
to
Cynthia
and
we
drove
away
Hes
a
dear
little
man
said
Cynthia
Id
no
idea
you
knew
him
Youve
been
entertaining
a
celebrity
unawares
I
replied
And
for
the
rest
of
the
way
home
I
recited
to
them
the
various
exploits
and
triumphs
of
We
arrived
back
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
As
we
entered
the
hall
Mrs
came
out
of
her
boudoir
She
looked
flushed
and
upset
Oh
its
you
she
said
Is
there
anything
the
matter
Aunt
Emily
asked
Cynthia
Certainly
not
said
Mrs
sharply
What
should
there
be
Then
catching
sight
of
Dorcas
the
going
into
the
she
called
to
her
to
bring
some
stamps
into
the
boudoir
Yes
mm
The
old
servant
hesitated
then
added
Dont
you
think
mm
youd
better
get
to
bed
Youre
looking
very
tired
Perhaps
youre
right
now
Ive
some
letters
I
must
finish
by
Have
you
lighted
the
fire
in
my
room
as
I
told
you
Yes
mm
Then
Ill
go
to
bed
directly
after
supper
She
went
into
the
boudoir
again
and
Cynthia
stared
after
her
Goodness
gracious
I
wonder
whats
up
she
said
to
Lawrence
He
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
her
for
without
a
word
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
of
the
house
I
suggested
a
quick
game
of
tennis
before
supper
and
Cynthia
agreeing
I
ran
upstairs
to
fetch
my
racquet
Mrs
Cavendish
was
coming
down
the
stairs
It
may
have
been
my
fancy
but
she
too
was
looking
odd
and
disturbed
Had
a
good
walk
with
Dr
I
asked
trying
to
appear
as
indifferent
as
I
could
I
didnt
go
she
replied
abruptly
Where
is
Mrs
In
the
boudoir
Her
hand
clenched
itself
on
the
banisters
then
she
seemed
to
nerve
herself
for
some
encounter
and
went
rapidly
past
me
down
the
stairs
across
the
hall
to
the
boudoir
the
door
of
which
she
shut
behind
her
As
I
ran
out
to
the
tennis
court
a
few
moments
later
I
had
to
pass
the
open
boudoir
window
and
was
unable
to
help
overhearing
the
following
scrap
of
dialogue
Mary
Cavendish
was
saying
in
the
voice
of
a
woman
desperately
controlling
herself
Then
you
wont
show
it
to
me
To
which
Mrs
replied
My
dear
Mary
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
matter
Then
show
it
to
me
I
tell
you
it
is
not
what
you
imagine
It
does
not
concern
you
in
the
least
To
which
Mary
Cavendish
replied
with
a
rising
bitterness
Of
course
I
might
have
known
you
would
shield
him
Cynthia
was
waiting
for
me
and
greeted
me
eagerly
with
I
say
Theres
been
the
most
awful
row
Ive
got
it
all
out
of
Dorcas
What
kind
of
a
row
Between
Aunt
Emily
and
him
I
do
hope
shes
found
him
out
at
last
Was
Dorcas
there
then
Of
course
not
She
happened
to
be
near
the
door
It
was
a
real
old
I
do
wish
I
knew
what
it
was
all
about
I
thought
of
Mrs
gipsy
face
and
warnings
but
wisely
decided
to
hold
my
peace
whilst
Cynthia
exhausted
every
possible
hypothesis
and
cheerfully
hoped
Aunt
Emily
will
send
him
away
and
will
never
speak
to
him
again
I
was
anxious
to
get
hold
of
John
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
Evidently
something
very
momentous
had
occurred
that
afternoon
I
tried
to
forget
the
few
words
I
had
overheard
but
do
what
I
would
I
could
not
dismiss
them
altogether
from
my
mind
What
was
Mary
concern
in
the
matter
Mr
was
in
the
when
I
came
down
to
supper
His
face
was
impassive
as
ever
and
the
strange
unreality
of
the
man
struck
me
afresh
Mrs
came
down
last
She
still
looked
agitated
and
during
the
meal
there
was
a
somewhat
constrained
silence
was
unusually
quiet
As
a
rule
he
surrounded
his
wife
with
little
attentions
placing
a
cushion
at
her
back
and
altogether
playing
the
part
of
the
devoted
husband
Immediately
after
supper
Mrs
retired
to
her
boudoir
again
Send
my
coffee
in
here
Mary
she
called
Ive
just
five
minutes
to
catch
the
post
Cynthia
and
I
went
and
sat
by
the
open
window
in
the
Mary
Cavendish
brought
our
coffee
to
us
She
seemed
excited
Do
you
young
people
want
lights
or
do
you
enjoy
the
twilight
she
asked
Will
you
take
Mrs
her
coffee
Cynthia
I
will
pour
it
out
Do
not
trouble
Mary
said
I
will
take
it
to
Emily
He
poured
it
out
and
went
out
of
the
room
carrying
it
carefully
Lawrence
followed
him
and
Mrs
Cavendish
sat
down
by
us
We
three
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
It
was
a
glorious
night
hot
and
still
Mrs
Cavendish
fanned
herself
gently
with
a
palm
leaf
Its
almost
too
hot
she
murmured
We
shall
have
a
thunderstorm
Alas
that
these
harmonious
moments
can
never
endure
My
paradise
was
rudely
shattered
by
the
sound
of
a
well
known
and
heartily
disliked
voice
in
the
hall
Dr
exclaimed
Cynthia
What
a
funny
time
to
come
I
glanced
jealously
at
Mary
Cavendish
but
she
seemed
quite
undisturbed
the
delicate
pallor
of
her
cheeks
did
not
vary
In
a
few
moments
Alfred
had
ushered
the
doctor
in
the
latter
laughing
and
protesting
that
he
was
in
no
fit
state
for
a
In
truth
he
presented
a
sorry
spectacle
being
literally
plastered
with
mud
What
have
you
been
doing
doctor
cried
Mrs
Cavendish
I
must
make
my
apologies
said
the
doctor
I
did
not
really
mean
to
come
in
but
Mr
insisted
Well
you
are
in
a
plight
said
John
strolling
in
from
the
hall
Have
some
coffee
and
tell
us
what
you
have
been
up
to
Thank
you
I
will
He
laughed
rather
as
he
described
how
he
had
discovered
a
very
rare
species
of
fern
in
an
inaccessible
place
and
in
his
efforts
to
obtain
it
had
lost
his
footing
and
slipped
ignominiously
into
a
neighbouring
pond
The
sun
soon
dried
me
off
he
added
but
Im
afraid
my
appearance
is
very
disreputable
At
this
juncture
Mrs
called
to
Cynthia
from
the
hall
and
the
girl
ran
out
Just
carry
up
my
will
you
dear
Im
going
to
bed
The
door
into
the
hall
was
a
wide
one
I
had
risen
when
Cynthia
did
John
was
close
by
me
There
were
therefore
three
witnesses
who
could
swear
that
Mrs
was
carrying
her
coffee
as
yet
in
her
hand
My
evening
was
utterly
and
entirely
spoilt
by
the
presence
of
Dr
It
seemed
to
me
the
man
would
never
go
He
rose
at
last
however
and
I
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Ill
walk
down
to
the
village
with
you
said
Mr
I
must
see
our
agent
over
those
estate
accounts
He
turned
to
John
No
one
need
sit
up
I
will
take
the
latchkey
To
make
this
part
of
my
story
clear
I
the
following
plan
of
the
first
floor
of
Styles
The
servants
rooms
are
reached
through
the
door
B
They
have
no
communication
with
the
right
wing
where
the
rooms
were
situated
It
seemed
to
be
the
middle
of
the
night
when
I
was
awakened
by
Lawrence
Cavendish
He
had
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
the
agitation
of
his
face
told
me
at
once
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
Whats
the
matter
I
asked
sitting
up
in
bed
and
trying
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
We
are
afraid
my
mother
is
very
ill
She
seems
to
be
having
some
kind
of
fit
Unfortunately
she
has
locked
herself
in
Ill
come
at
once
I
sprang
out
of
bed
and
pulling
on
a
followed
Lawrence
along
the
passage
and
the
gallery
to
the
right
wing
of
the
house
John
Cavendish
joined
us
and
one
or
two
of
the
servants
were
standing
round
in
a
state
of
excitement
Lawrence
turned
to
his
brother
What
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
Never
I
thought
had
his
indecision
of
character
been
more
apparent
John
rattled
the
handle
of
Mrs
door
violently
but
with
no
effect
It
was
obviously
locked
or
bolted
on
the
inside
The
whole
household
was
aroused
by
now
The
most
alarming
sounds
were
audible
from
the
interior
of
the
room
Clearly
something
must
be
done
Try
going
through
Mr
room
sir
cried
Dorcas
Oh
the
poor
mistress
Suddenly
I
realized
that
Alfred
was
not
with
he
alone
had
given
no
sign
of
his
presence
John
opened
the
door
of
his
room
It
was
pitch
dark
but
Lawrence
was
following
with
the
candle
and
by
its
feeble
light
we
saw
that
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
and
that
there
was
no
sign
of
the
room
having
been
occupied
We
went
straight
to
the
connecting
door
That
too
was
locked
or
bolted
on
the
inside
What
was
to
be
done
Oh
dear
sir
cried
Dorcas
wringing
her
hands
what
ever
shall
we
do
We
must
try
and
break
the
door
in
I
suppose
Itll
be
a
tough
job
though
Here
let
one
of
the
maids
go
down
and
wake
and
tell
him
to
go
for
Dr
at
once
Now
then
well
have
a
try
at
the
door
Half
a
moment
though
isnt
there
a
door
into
Miss
rooms
Yes
sir
but
thats
always
bolted
Its
never
been
undone
Well
we
might
just
see
He
ran
rapidly
down
the
corridor
to
room
Mary
Cavendish
was
there
shaking
the
girl
who
must
have
been
an
unusually
sound
sleeper
and
trying
to
wake
her
In
a
moment
or
two
he
was
back
No
good
Thats
bolted
too
We
must
break
in
the
door
I
think
this
one
is
a
shade
less
solid
than
the
one
in
the
passage
We
strained
and
heaved
together
The
framework
of
the
door
was
solid
and
for
a
long
time
it
resisted
our
efforts
but
at
last
we
felt
it
give
beneath
our
weight
and
finally
with
a
resounding
crash
it
was
burst
open
We
stumbled
in
together
Lawrence
still
holding
his
candle
Mrs
was
lying
on
the
bed
her
whole
form
agitated
by
violent
convulsions
in
one
of
which
she
must
have
overturned
the
table
beside
her
As
we
entered
however
her
limbs
relaxed
and
she
fell
back
upon
the
pillows
John
strode
across
the
room
and
lit
the
gas
Turning
to
Annie
one
of
the
housemaids
he
sent
her
downstairs
to
the
for
brandy
Then
he
went
across
to
his
mother
whilst
I
the
door
that
gave
on
the
corridor
I
turned
to
Lawrence
to
suggest
that
I
had
better
leave
them
now
that
there
was
no
further
need
of
my
services
but
the
words
were
frozen
on
my
lips
Never
have
I
seen
such
a
ghastly
look
on
any
mans
face
He
was
white
as
chalk
the
candle
he
held
in
his
shaking
hand
was
sputtering
onto
the
carpet
and
his
eyes
petrified
with
terror
or
some
such
kindred
emotion
stared
over
my
head
at
a
point
on
the
further
wall
It
was
as
though
he
had
seen
something
that
turned
him
to
stone
I
instinctively
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
but
I
could
see
nothing
unusual
The
still
feebly
flickering
ashes
in
the
grate
and
the
row
of
prim
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
were
surely
harmless
enough
The
violence
of
Mrs
attack
seemed
to
be
passing
She
was
able
to
speak
in
short
gasps
Better
of
lock
myself
in
A
shadow
fell
on
the
bed
and
looking
up
I
saw
Mary
Cavendish
standing
near
the
door
with
her
arm
around
Cynthia
She
seemed
to
be
supporting
the
girl
who
looked
utterly
dazed
and
unlike
herself
Her
face
was
heavily
flushed
and
she
yawned
repeatedly
Poor
Cynthia
is
quite
frightened
said
Mrs
Cavendish
in
a
low
clear
voice
She
herself
I
noticed
was
dressed
in
her
white
land
smock
Then
it
must
be
later
than
I
thought
I
saw
that
a
faint
streak
of
daylight
was
showing
through
the
curtains
of
the
windows
and
that
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
pointed
to
close
upon
five
oclock
A
strangled
cry
from
the
bed
startled
me
A
fresh
access
of
pain
seized
the
unfortunate
old
lady
The
convulsions
were
of
a
violence
terrible
to
behold
Everything
was
confusion
We
round
her
powerless
to
help
or
alleviate
A
final
convulsion
lifted
her
from
the
bed
until
she
appeared
to
rest
upon
her
head
and
her
heels
with
her
body
arched
in
an
extraordinary
manner
In
vain
Mary
and
John
tried
to
administer
more
brandy
The
moments
flew
Again
the
body
arched
itself
in
that
peculiar
fashion
At
that
moment
Dr
pushed
his
way
authoritatively
into
the
room
For
one
instant
he
stopped
dead
staring
at
the
figure
on
the
bed
and
at
the
same
instant
Mrs
cried
out
in
a
strangled
voice
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
doctor
Then
she
fell
back
motionless
on
the
pillows
With
a
stride
the
doctor
reached
the
bed
and
seizing
her
arms
worked
them
energetically
applying
what
I
knew
to
be
artificial
respiration
He
issued
a
few
short
sharp
orders
to
the
servants
An
imperious
wave
of
his
hand
drove
us
all
to
the
door
We
watched
him
fascinated
though
I
think
we
all
knew
in
our
hearts
that
it
was
too
late
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
now
I
could
see
by
the
expression
on
his
face
that
he
himself
had
little
hope
Finally
he
abandoned
his
task
shaking
his
head
gravely
At
that
moment
we
heard
footsteps
outside
and
Dr
Mrs
own
doctor
a
portly
fussy
little
man
came
bustling
in
In
a
few
words
explained
how
he
had
happened
to
be
passing
the
lodge
gates
as
the
car
came
out
and
had
run
up
to
the
house
as
fast
as
he
could
whilst
the
car
went
on
to
fetch
Dr
With
a
faint
gesture
of
the
hand
he
indicated
the
figure
on
the
bed
Very
sad
Very
sad
murmured
Dr
Poor
dear
lady
Always
did
far
too
too
my
advice
I
warned
her
Her
heart
was
far
from
strong
Take
it
easy
I
said
to
her
But
zeal
for
good
works
was
too
great
Nature
rebelled
Dr
I
noticed
was
watching
the
local
doctor
narrowly
He
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
he
spoke
The
convulsions
were
of
a
peculiar
violence
Dr
I
am
sorry
you
were
not
here
in
time
to
witness
them
They
were
in
character
Ah
said
Dr
wisely
I
should
like
to
speak
to
you
in
private
said
Dr
He
turned
to
John
You
do
not
object
Certainly
not
We
all
trooped
out
into
the
corridor
leaving
the
two
doctors
alone
and
I
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
behind
us
We
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
I
was
violently
excited
I
have
a
certain
talent
for
deduction
and
Dr
manner
had
started
a
flock
of
wild
surmises
in
my
mind
Mary
Cavendish
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
What
is
it
Why
did
Dr
seem
I
looked
at
her
Do
you
know
what
I
think
What
Listen
I
looked
round
the
others
were
out
of
earshot
I
lowered
my
voice
to
a
whisper
I
believe
she
has
been
poisoned
Im
certain
Dr
suspects
it
What
She
shrank
against
the
wall
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilating
wildly
Then
with
a
sudden
cry
that
startled
me
she
cried
out
No
that
And
breaking
from
me
fled
up
the
stairs
I
followed
her
afraid
that
she
was
going
to
faint
I
found
her
leaning
against
the
bannisters
deadly
pale
She
waved
me
away
impatiently
No
me
Id
rather
be
alone
Let
me
just
be
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
Go
down
to
the
others
I
obeyed
her
reluctantly
John
and
Lawrence
were
in
the
I
joined
them
We
were
all
silent
but
I
suppose
I
voiced
the
thoughts
of
us
all
when
I
at
last
broke
it
by
saying
Where
is
Mr
John
shook
his
head
Hes
not
in
the
house
Our
eyes
met
Where
was
Alfred
His
absence
was
strange
and
inexplicable
I
remembered
Mrs
dying
words
What
lay
beneath
them
What
more
could
she
have
told
us
if
she
had
had
time
At
last
we
heard
the
doctors
descending
the
stairs
Dr
was
looking
important
and
excited
and
trying
to
conceal
an
inward
exultation
under
a
manner
of
decorous
calm
Dr
remained
in
the
background
his
grave
bearded
face
unchanged
Dr
was
the
spokesman
for
the
two
He
addressed
himself
to
John
Mr
Cavendish
I
should
like
your
consent
to
a
postmortem
Is
that
necessary
asked
John
gravely
A
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
Absolutely
said
Dr
You
mean
by
that
That
neither
Dr
nor
myself
could
give
a
death
certificate
under
the
circumstances
John
bent
his
head
In
that
case
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
agree
Thank
you
said
Dr
briskly
We
propose
that
it
should
take
place
tomorrow
rather
tonight
And
he
glanced
at
the
daylight
Under
the
circumstances
I
am
afraid
an
inquest
can
hardly
be
formalities
are
necessary
but
I
beg
that
you
wont
distress
yourselves
There
was
a
pause
and
then
Dr
drew
two
keys
from
his
pocket
and
handed
them
to
John
These
are
the
keys
of
the
two
rooms
I
have
locked
them
and
in
my
opinion
they
would
be
better
kept
locked
for
the
present
The
doctors
then
departed
I
had
been
turning
over
an
idea
in
my
head
and
I
felt
that
the
moment
had
now
come
to
broach
it
Yet
I
was
a
little
of
doing
so
John
I
knew
had
a
horror
of
any
kind
of
publicity
and
was
an
easygoing
optimist
who
preferred
never
to
meet
trouble
halfway
It
might
be
difficult
to
convince
him
of
the
soundness
of
my
plan
Lawrence
on
the
other
hand
being
less
conventional
and
having
more
imagination
I
felt
I
might
count
upon
as
an
ally
There
was
no
doubt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
me
to
take
the
lead
John
I
said
I
am
going
to
ask
you
something
Well
You
remember
my
speaking
of
my
friend
The
Belgian
who
is
here
He
has
been
a
most
famous
detective
Yes
I
want
you
to
let
me
call
him
into
investigate
this
matter
Before
the
postmortem
Yes
time
is
an
advantage
has
been
foul
play
Rubbish
cried
Lawrence
angrily
In
my
opinion
the
whole
thing
is
a
mares
nest
of
hadnt
an
idea
of
such
a
thing
until
put
it
into
his
head
But
like
all
specialists
got
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
Poisons
are
his
hobby
so
of
course
he
sees
them
everywhere
I
confess
that
I
was
surprised
by
attitude
He
was
so
seldom
vehement
about
anything
John
hesitated
I
cant
feel
as
you
do
Lawrence
he
said
at
last
Im
inclined
to
give
Hastings
a
free
hand
though
I
should
prefer
to
wait
a
bit
We
dont
want
any
unnecessary
scandal
No
no
I
cried
eagerly
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
is
discretion
itself
Very
well
then
have
it
your
own
way
I
leave
it
in
your
hands
Though
if
it
is
as
we
suspect
it
seems
a
clear
enough
case
God
forgive
me
if
I
am
him
I
looked
at
my
watch
It
was
six
oclock
I
determined
to
lose
no
time
Five
minutes
delay
however
I
allowed
myself
I
spent
it
in
ransacking
the
library
until
I
discovered
a
medical
book
which
gave
a
description
of
strychnine
poisoning
The
house
which
the
Belgians
occupied
in
the
village
was
quite
close
to
the
park
gates
One
could
save
time
by
taking
a
narrow
path
through
the
long
grass
which
cut
off
the
detours
of
the
winding
drive
So
I
accordingly
went
that
way
I
had
nearly
reached
the
lodge
when
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
running
figure
of
a
man
approaching
me
It
was
Mr
Where
had
he
been
How
did
he
intend
to
explain
his
absence
He
accosted
me
eagerly
My
God
This
is
terrible
My
poor
wife
I
have
only
just
heard
Where
have
you
been
I
asked
kept
me
late
last
night
It
was
one
oclock
before
wed
finished
Then
I
found
that
Id
forgotten
the
latchkey
after
all
I
didnt
want
to
arouse
the
household
so
gave
me
a
bed
How
did
you
hear
the
news
I
asked
knocked
up
to
tell
him
My
poor
Emily
She
was
so
a
noble
character
She
overtaxed
her
strength
A
wave
of
revulsion
swept
over
me
What
a
consummate
hypocrite
the
man
was
I
must
hurry
on
I
said
thankful
that
he
did
not
ask
me
whither
I
was
bound
In
a
few
minutes
I
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
Leastways
Cottage
Getting
no
answer
I
repeated
my
summons
impatiently
A
window
above
me
was
cautiously
opened
and
himself
looked
out
He
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
seeing
me
In
a
few
brief
words
I
explained
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
and
that
I
wanted
his
help
Wait
my
friend
I
will
let
you
in
and
you
shall
recount
to
me
the
affair
whilst
I
dress
In
a
few
moments
he
had
unbarred
the
door
and
I
followed
him
up
to
his
room
There
he
installed
me
in
a
chair
and
I
related
the
whole
story
keeping
back
nothing
and
omitting
no
circumstance
however
insignificant
whilst
he
himself
made
a
careful
and
deliberate
toilet
I
told
him
of
my
awakening
of
Mrs
dying
words
of
her
husbands
absence
of
the
quarrel
the
day
before
of
the
scrap
of
conversation
between
Mary
and
her
that
I
had
overheard
of
the
former
quarrel
between
Mrs
and
and
of
the
innuendoes
I
was
hardly
as
clear
as
I
could
wish
I
repeated
myself
several
times
and
occasionally
had
to
go
back
to
some
detail
that
I
had
forgotten
smiled
kindly
on
me
The
mind
is
confused
Is
it
not
so
Take
time
mon
ami
You
are
agitated
you
are
is
but
natural
Presently
when
we
are
calmer
we
will
arrange
the
facts
neatly
each
in
his
proper
place
We
will
reject
Those
of
importance
we
will
put
on
one
side
those
of
no
importance
screwed
up
his
face
and
puffed
comically
them
away
Thats
all
very
well
I
objected
but
how
are
you
going
to
decide
what
is
important
and
what
isnt
That
always
seems
the
difficulty
to
me
shook
his
head
energetically
He
was
now
arranging
his
moustache
with
exquisite
care
Not
so
One
fact
leads
to
we
continue
Does
the
next
fit
in
with
that
A
Good
We
can
proceed
This
next
little
Ah
that
is
curious
There
is
something
link
in
the
chain
that
is
not
there
We
examine
We
search
And
that
little
curious
fact
that
possibly
paltry
little
detail
that
will
not
tally
we
put
it
here
He
made
an
extravagant
gesture
with
his
hand
It
is
significant
It
is
tremendous
Yes
Ah
shook
his
forefinger
so
fiercely
at
me
that
I
before
it
Beware
Peril
to
the
detective
who
says
It
is
so
does
not
matter
It
will
not
agree
I
will
forget
it
That
way
lies
confusion
Everything
matters
I
know
You
always
told
me
that
Thats
why
I
have
gone
into
all
the
details
of
this
thing
whether
they
seemed
to
me
relevant
or
not
And
I
am
pleased
with
you
You
have
a
good
memory
and
you
have
given
me
the
facts
faithfully
Of
the
order
in
which
you
present
them
I
say
it
is
deplorable
But
I
make
are
upset
To
that
I
attribute
the
circumstance
that
you
have
omitted
one
fact
of
paramount
importance
What
is
that
I
asked
You
have
not
told
me
if
Mrs
ate
well
last
night
I
stared
at
him
Surely
the
war
had
affected
the
little
mans
brain
He
was
carefully
engaged
in
brushing
his
coat
before
putting
it
on
and
seemed
wholly
engrossed
in
the
task
I
dont
remember
I
said
And
anyway
I
dont
see
You
do
not
see
But
it
is
of
the
first
importance
I
cant
see
why
I
said
rather
As
far
as
I
can
remember
she
didnt
eat
much
She
was
obviously
upset
and
it
had
taken
her
appetite
away
That
was
only
natural
Yes
said
thoughtfully
it
was
only
natural
He
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
small
then
turned
to
me
Now
I
am
ready
We
will
proceed
to
the
chateau
and
study
matters
on
the
spot
Excuse
me
mon
ami
you
dressed
in
haste
and
your
tie
is
on
one
side
Permit
me
With
a
deft
gesture
he
rearranged
it
Now
shall
we
start
We
hurried
up
the
village
and
turned
in
at
the
lodge
gates
stopped
for
a
moment
and
gazed
over
the
beautiful
expanse
of
park
still
glittering
with
morning
dew
So
beautiful
so
beautiful
and
yet
the
poor
family
plunged
in
sorrow
prostrated
with
grief
He
looked
at
me
keenly
as
he
spoke
and
I
was
aware
that
I
reddened
under
his
prolonged
gaze
Was
the
family
prostrated
by
grief
Was
the
sorrow
at
Mrs
death
so
great
I
realized
that
there
was
an
emotional
lack
in
the
atmosphere
The
dead
woman
had
not
the
gift
of
commanding
love
Her
death
was
a
shock
and
a
distress
but
she
would
not
be
passionately
regretted
seemed
to
follow
my
thoughts
He
nodded
his
head
gravely
No
you
are
right
he
said
it
is
not
as
though
there
was
a
blood
tie
She
has
been
kind
and
generous
to
these
but
she
was
not
their
own
mother
Blood
remember
tells
I
said
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
you
wanted
to
know
if
Mrs
ate
well
last
night
I
have
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
but
I
cant
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
He
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
as
we
walked
along
but
finally
he
said
I
do
not
mind
telling
as
you
know
it
is
not
my
habit
to
explain
until
the
end
is
reached
The
present
contention
is
that
Mrs
died
of
strychnine
poisoning
presumably
administered
in
her
coffee
Yes
Well
what
time
was
the
coffee
served
About
eight
oclock
Therefore
she
drank
it
between
then
and
not
much
later
Well
strychnine
is
a
fairly
rapid
poison
Its
effects
would
be
felt
very
soon
probably
in
about
an
hour
Yet
in
Mrs
case
the
symptoms
do
not
manifest
themselves
until
five
oclock
the
next
morning
nine
hours
But
a
heavy
meal
taken
at
about
the
same
time
as
the
poison
might
retard
its
effects
though
hardly
to
that
extent
Still
it
is
a
possibility
to
be
taken
into
account
But
according
to
you
she
ate
very
little
for
supper
and
yet
the
symptoms
do
not
develop
until
early
the
next
morning
Now
that
is
a
curious
circumstance
my
friend
Something
may
arise
at
the
autopsy
to
explain
it
In
the
meantime
remember
it
As
we
neared
the
house
John
came
out
and
met
us
His
face
looked
weary
and
haggard
This
is
a
very
dreadful
business
Monsieur
he
said
Hastings
has
explained
to
you
that
we
are
anxious
for
no
publicity
I
comprehend
perfectly
You
see
it
is
only
suspicion
so
far
We
have
nothing
to
go
upon
Precisely
It
is
a
matter
of
precaution
only
John
turned
to
me
taking
out
his
and
lighting
a
cigarette
as
he
did
so
You
know
that
fellow
is
back
Yes
I
met
him
John
flung
the
match
into
an
adjacent
flower
bed
a
proceeding
which
was
too
much
for
feelings
He
retrieved
it
and
buried
it
neatly
Its
jolly
difficult
to
know
how
to
treat
him
That
difficulty
will
not
exist
long
pronounced
quietly
John
looked
puzzled
not
quite
understanding
the
portent
of
this
cryptic
saying
He
handed
the
two
keys
which
Dr
had
given
him
to
me
Show
Monsieur
everything
he
wants
to
see
The
rooms
are
locked
asked
Dr
considered
it
advisable
nodded
thoughtfully
Then
he
is
very
sure
Well
that
simplifies
matters
for
us
We
went
up
together
to
the
room
of
the
tragedy
For
convenience
I
a
plan
of
the
room
and
the
principal
articles
of
furniture
in
it
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
and
proceeded
to
a
minute
inspection
of
the
room
He
darted
from
one
object
to
the
other
with
the
agility
of
a
grasshopper
I
remained
by
the
door
fearing
to
obliterate
any
clues
however
did
not
seem
grateful
to
me
for
my
forbearance
What
have
you
my
friend
he
cried
that
you
remain
there
do
you
say
yes
the
stuck
pig
I
explained
that
I
was
afraid
of
obliterating
any
footmarks
Footmarks
But
what
an
idea
There
has
already
been
practically
an
army
in
the
room
What
footmarks
are
we
likely
to
find
No
come
here
and
aid
me
in
my
search
I
will
put
down
my
little
case
until
I
need
it
He
did
so
on
the
round
table
by
the
window
but
it
was
an
proceeding
for
the
top
of
it
being
loose
it
tilted
up
and
precipitated
the
on
the
floor
Eh
voila
table
cried
Ah
my
friend
one
may
live
in
a
big
house
and
yet
have
no
comfort
After
which
piece
of
moralizing
he
resumed
his
search
A
small
purple
with
a
key
in
the
lock
on
the
engaged
his
attention
for
some
time
He
took
out
the
key
from
the
lock
and
passed
it
to
me
to
inspect
I
saw
nothing
peculiar
however
It
was
an
ordinary
key
of
the
Yale
type
with
a
bit
of
twisted
wire
through
the
handle
Next
he
examined
the
framework
of
the
door
we
had
broken
in
assuring
himself
that
the
bolt
had
really
been
shot
Then
he
went
to
the
door
opposite
leading
into
room
That
door
was
also
bolted
as
I
had
stated
However
he
went
to
the
length
of
it
and
opening
and
shutting
it
several
times
this
he
did
with
the
utmost
precaution
against
making
any
noise
Suddenly
something
in
the
bolt
itself
seemed
to
rivet
his
attention
He
examined
it
carefully
and
then
nimbly
whipping
out
a
pair
of
small
forceps
from
his
case
he
drew
out
some
minute
particle
which
he
carefully
sealed
up
in
a
tiny
envelope
On
the
chest
of
drawers
there
was
a
tray
with
a
spirit
lamp
and
a
small
saucepan
on
it
A
small
quantity
of
a
dark
fluid
remained
in
the
saucepan
and
an
empty
cup
and
saucer
that
had
been
drunk
out
of
stood
near
it
I
wondered
how
I
could
have
been
so
as
to
overlook
this
Here
was
a
clue
worth
having
delicately
dipped
his
finger
into
liquid
and
tasted
it
gingerly
He
made
a
grimace
in
it
He
passed
on
to
the
debris
on
the
floor
where
the
table
by
the
bed
had
been
overturned
A
some
books
matches
a
bunch
of
keys
and
the
crushed
fragments
of
a
lay
scattered
about
Ah
this
is
curious
said
I
must
confess
that
I
see
nothing
particularly
curious
about
it
You
do
not
Observe
the
chimney
is
broken
in
two
places
they
lie
there
as
they
fell
But
see
the
is
absolutely
smashed
to
powder
Well
I
said
wearily
I
suppose
some
one
must
have
stepped
on
it
Exactly
said
in
an
odd
voice
Some
one
stepped
on
it
He
rose
from
his
knees
and
walked
slowly
across
to
the
mantelpiece
where
he
stood
fingering
the
ornaments
and
straightening
thema
trick
of
his
when
he
was
agitated
Mon
ami
he
said
turning
to
me
somebody
stepped
on
that
cup
grinding
it
to
powder
and
the
reason
they
did
so
was
either
because
it
contained
strychnine
is
far
more
it
did
not
contain
strychnine
I
made
no
reply
I
was
bewildered
but
I
knew
that
it
was
no
good
asking
him
to
explain
In
a
moment
or
two
he
roused
himself
and
went
on
with
his
investigations
He
picked
up
the
bunch
of
keys
from
the
floor
and
twirling
them
round
in
his
fingers
finally
selected
one
very
bright
and
shining
which
he
tried
in
the
lock
of
the
purple
It
fitted
and
he
opened
the
box
but
after
a
moments
hesitation
closed
and
it
and
slipped
the
bunch
of
keys
as
well
as
the
key
that
had
originally
stood
in
the
lock
into
his
own
pocket
I
have
no
authority
to
go
through
these
papers
But
it
should
be
once
He
then
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
drawers
of
the
washstand
Crossing
the
room
to
the
window
a
round
stain
hardly
visible
on
the
dark
brown
carpet
seemed
to
interest
him
particularly
He
went
down
on
his
knees
examining
it
going
so
far
as
to
smell
it
Finally
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
cocoa
into
a
test
tube
sealing
it
up
carefully
His
next
proceeding
was
to
take
out
a
little
notebook
We
have
found
in
this
room
he
said
writing
busily
six
points
of
interest
Shall
I
enumerate
them
or
will
you
Oh
you
I
replied
hastily
Very
well
then
One
a
that
has
been
ground
into
powder
two
a
with
a
key
in
the
lock
three
a
stain
on
the
floor
That
may
have
been
done
some
time
ago
I
interrupted
No
for
it
is
still
damp
and
smells
of
coffee
Four
a
fragment
of
some
dark
green
a
thread
or
two
but
recognizable
Ah
I
cried
That
was
what
you
sealed
up
in
the
envelope
Yes
It
may
turn
out
to
be
a
piece
of
one
of
Mrs
own
dresses
and
quite
unimportant
We
shall
see
Five
this
With
a
dramatic
gesture
he
pointed
to
a
large
splash
of
candle
grease
on
the
floor
by
the
It
must
have
been
done
since
yesterday
otherwise
a
good
housemaid
would
have
at
once
removed
it
with
and
a
hot
iron
One
of
my
best
hats
that
is
not
to
the
point
It
was
very
likely
done
last
night
We
were
very
agitated
Or
perhaps
Mrs
herself
dropped
her
candle
You
brought
only
one
candle
into
the
room
Yes
Lawrence
Cavendish
was
carrying
it
But
he
was
very
upset
He
seemed
to
see
something
over
indicated
the
absolutely
paralysed
him
That
is
interesting
said
quickly
Yes
it
is
eye
sweeping
the
whole
length
of
the
it
was
not
his
candle
that
made
this
great
patch
for
you
perceive
that
this
is
white
grease
whereas
Monsieur
candle
which
is
still
on
the
is
pink
On
the
other
hand
Mrs
had
no
candlestick
in
the
room
only
a
Then
I
said
what
do
you
deduce
To
which
my
friend
only
made
a
rather
irritating
reply
urging
me
to
use
my
own
natural
faculties
And
the
sixth
point
I
asked
I
suppose
it
is
the
sample
of
cocoa
No
said
thoughtfully
I
might
have
included
that
in
the
six
but
I
did
not
No
the
sixth
point
I
will
keep
to
myself
for
the
present
He
looked
quickly
round
the
room
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
I
think
stared
earnestly
and
long
at
the
dead
ashes
in
the
grate
The
fire
it
destroys
But
by
might
us
see
Deftly
on
hands
and
knees
he
began
to
sort
the
ashes
from
the
grate
into
the
fender
handling
them
with
the
greatest
caution
Suddenly
he
gave
a
faint
exclamation
The
forceps
Hastings
I
quickly
handed
them
to
him
and
with
skill
he
extracted
a
small
piece
of
half
charred
paper
There
mon
ami
he
cried
What
do
you
think
of
that
I
scrutinized
the
fragment
This
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
it
I
was
puzzled
It
was
unusually
thick
quite
unlike
ordinary
notepaper
Suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
I
cried
This
is
a
fragment
of
a
will
Exactly
I
looked
up
at
him
sharply
You
are
not
surprised
No
he
said
gravely
I
expected
it
I
relinquished
the
piece
of
paper
and
watched
him
put
it
away
in
his
case
with
the
same
methodical
care
that
he
bestowed
on
everything
My
brain
was
in
a
whirl
What
was
this
complication
of
a
will
Who
had
destroyed
it
The
person
who
had
left
the
candle
grease
on
the
floor
Obviously
But
how
had
anyone
gained
admission
All
the
doors
had
been
bolted
on
the
inside
Now
my
friend
said
briskly
we
will
go
I
should
like
to
ask
a
few
questions
of
the
her
name
is
is
it
not
We
passed
through
Alfred
room
and
delayed
long
enough
to
make
a
brief
but
fairly
comprehensive
examination
of
it
We
went
out
through
that
door
locking
both
it
and
that
of
Mrs
room
as
before
I
took
him
down
to
the
boudoir
which
he
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
and
went
myself
in
search
of
Dorcas
When
I
returned
with
her
however
the
boudoir
was
empty
I
cried
where
are
you
I
am
here
my
friend
He
had
stepped
outside
the
French
window
and
was
standing
apparently
lost
in
admiration
before
the
various
shaped
flower
beds
Admirable
he
murmured
Admirable
What
symmetry
Observe
that
crescent
and
those
neatness
rejoices
the
eye
The
spacing
of
the
plants
also
is
perfect
It
has
been
recently
done
is
it
not
so
Yes
I
believe
they
were
at
it
yesterday
afternoon
But
come
is
here
Eh
bien
eh
bien
Do
not
grudge
me
a
moments
satisfaction
of
the
eye
Yes
but
this
affair
is
more
important
And
how
do
you
know
that
these
fine
begonias
are
not
of
equal
importance
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
There
was
really
no
arguing
with
him
if
he
chose
to
take
that
line
You
do
not
agree
But
such
things
have
been
Well
we
will
come
in
and
interview
the
brave
Dorcas
Dorcas
was
standing
in
the
boudoir
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
and
her
grey
hair
rose
in
stiff
waves
under
her
white
cap
She
was
the
very
model
and
picture
of
a
good
servant
In
her
attitude
towards
she
was
inclined
to
be
suspicious
but
he
soon
broke
down
her
defences
He
drew
forward
a
chair
Pray
be
seated
mademoiselle
Thank
you
sir
You
have
been
with
your
mistress
many
years
is
it
not
so
Ten
years
sir
That
is
a
long
time
and
very
faithful
service
You
were
much
attached
to
her
were
you
not
She
was
a
very
good
mistress
to
me
sir
Then
you
will
not
object
to
answering
a
few
questions
I
put
them
to
you
with
Mr
full
approval
Oh
certainly
sir
Then
I
will
begin
by
asking
you
about
the
events
of
yesterday
afternoon
Your
mistress
had
a
quarrel
Yes
sir
But
I
dont
know
that
I
ought
Dorcas
hesitated
looked
at
her
keenly
My
good
Dorcas
it
is
necessary
that
I
should
know
every
detail
of
that
quarrel
as
fully
as
possible
Do
not
think
that
you
are
betraying
your
secrets
Your
mistress
lies
dead
and
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
know
we
are
to
avenge
her
Nothing
can
bring
her
back
to
life
but
we
do
hope
if
there
has
been
foul
play
to
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
Amen
to
that
said
Dorcas
fiercely
And
naming
no
names
theres
one
in
this
house
that
none
of
us
could
ever
abide
And
an
ill
day
it
was
when
first
he
darkened
the
threshold
waited
for
her
indignation
to
subside
and
then
resuming
his
businesslike
tone
he
asked
Now
as
to
this
quarrel
What
is
the
first
you
heard
of
it
Well
sir
I
happened
to
be
going
along
the
hall
outside
yesterday
What
time
was
that
I
couldnt
say
exactly
sir
but
it
wasnt
teatime
by
a
long
way
Perhaps
four
it
may
have
been
a
bit
later
Well
sir
as
I
said
I
happened
to
be
passing
along
when
I
heard
voices
very
loud
and
angry
in
here
I
didnt
exactly
mean
to
listen
there
it
is
I
stopped
The
door
was
shut
but
the
mistress
was
speaking
very
sharp
and
clear
and
I
heard
what
she
said
quite
plainly
You
have
lied
to
me
and
deceived
me
she
said
I
didnt
hear
what
Mr
replied
He
spoke
a
good
bit
lower
than
she
she
answered
How
dare
you
I
have
kept
you
and
clothed
you
and
fed
you
You
owe
everything
to
me
And
this
is
how
you
repay
me
By
bringing
disgrace
upon
our
name
Again
I
didnt
hear
what
he
said
but
she
went
on
Nothing
that
you
can
say
will
make
any
difference
I
see
my
duty
clearly
My
mind
is
made
up
You
need
not
think
that
any
fear
of
publicity
or
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
will
deter
me
Then
I
thought
I
heard
them
coming
out
so
I
went
off
quickly
You
are
sure
it
was
Mr
voice
you
heard
Oh
yes
sir
whose
elses
could
it
be
Well
what
happened
next
Later
I
came
back
to
the
hall
but
it
was
all
quiet
At
five
oclock
Mrs
rang
the
bell
and
told
me
to
bring
her
a
cup
of
to
the
boudoir
She
was
looking
white
and
upset
Dorcas
she
says
Ive
had
a
great
shock
Im
sorry
for
that
mm
I
says
feel
better
after
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
mm
She
had
something
in
her
hand
I
dont
know
if
it
was
a
letter
or
just
a
piece
of
paper
but
it
had
writing
on
it
and
she
kept
staring
at
it
almost
as
if
she
couldnt
believe
what
was
written
there
She
whispered
to
herself
as
though
she
had
forgotten
I
was
there
These
few
changed
And
then
she
says
to
me
Never
trust
a
man
Dorcas
theyre
not
worth
it
I
hurried
off
and
got
her
a
good
strong
cup
of
tea
and
she
thanked
me
and
said
shed
feel
better
when
shed
drunk
it
I
dont
know
what
to
do
she
says
Scandal
between
husband
and
wife
is
a
dreadful
thing
Dorcas
Id
rather
hush
it
up
if
I
could
Mrs
Cavendish
came
in
just
then
so
she
didnt
say
any
more
She
still
had
the
letter
or
whatever
it
was
in
her
hand
Yes
sir
What
would
she
be
likely
to
do
with
it
afterwards
Well
I
dont
know
sir
I
expect
she
would
lock
it
up
in
that
purple
case
of
hers
Is
that
where
she
usually
kept
important
papers
Yes
sir
She
brought
it
down
with
her
every
morning
and
took
it
up
every
night
When
did
she
lose
the
key
of
it
She
missed
it
yesterday
at
lunchtime
sir
and
told
me
to
look
carefully
for
it
She
was
very
much
put
out
about
it
But
she
had
a
duplicate
key
Oh
yes
sir
Dorcas
was
looking
very
curiously
at
him
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
was
I
What
was
all
this
about
a
lost
key
smiled
Never
mind
Dorcas
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
Is
this
the
key
that
was
lost
He
drew
from
his
pocket
the
key
that
he
had
found
in
the
lock
of
the
upstairs
eyes
looked
as
though
they
would
pop
out
of
her
head
Thats
it
sir
right
enough
But
where
did
you
find
it
I
looked
everywhere
for
it
Ah
but
you
see
it
was
not
in
the
same
place
yesterday
as
it
was
today
Now
to
pass
to
another
subject
had
your
mistress
a
dark
green
dress
in
her
wardrobe
Dorcas
was
rather
startled
by
the
unexpected
question
No
sir
Are
you
quite
sure
Oh
yes
sir
Has
anyone
else
in
the
house
got
a
green
dress
Dorcas
reflected
Miss
Cynthia
has
a
green
evening
dress
Light
or
dark
green
A
light
green
sir
a
sort
of
chiffon
they
call
it
Ah
that
is
not
what
I
want
And
nobody
else
has
anything
green
No
that
I
know
of
face
did
not
betray
a
trace
of
whether
he
was
disappointed
or
otherwise
He
merely
remarked
Good
we
will
leave
that
and
pass
on
Have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
your
mistress
was
likely
to
take
a
sleeping
powder
last
night
Not
last
night
sir
I
know
she
didnt
Why
do
you
know
so
positively
Because
the
box
was
empty
She
took
the
last
one
two
days
ago
and
she
didnt
have
any
more
made
up
You
are
quite
sure
of
that
Positive
sir
Then
that
is
cleared
up
By
the
way
your
mistress
didnt
ask
you
to
sign
any
paper
yesterday
To
sign
a
paper
No
sir
When
Mr
Hastings
and
Mr
Lawrence
came
in
yesterday
evening
they
found
your
mistress
busy
writing
letters
I
suppose
you
can
give
me
no
idea
to
whom
these
letters
were
addressed
Im
afraid
I
couldnt
sir
I
was
out
in
the
evening
Perhaps
Annie
could
tell
you
though
shes
a
careless
girl
Never
cleared
the
away
last
night
Thats
what
happens
when
Im
not
here
to
look
after
things
lifted
his
hand
Since
they
have
been
left
Dorcas
leave
them
a
little
longer
I
pray
you
I
should
like
to
examine
them
Very
well
sir
What
time
did
you
go
out
last
evening
About
six
oclock
sir
Thank
you
Dorcas
that
is
all
I
have
to
ask
you
He
rose
and
strolled
to
the
window
I
have
been
admiring
these
flower
beds
How
many
gardeners
are
employed
here
by
the
way
Only
three
now
sir
Five
we
had
before
the
war
when
it
was
kept
as
a
place
should
be
I
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
then
sir
A
fair
sight
it
was
But
now
theres
only
old
Manning
and
young
William
and
a
woman
gardener
in
breeches
and
suchlike
Ah
these
are
dreadful
times
The
good
times
will
come
again
Dorcas
At
least
we
hope
so
Now
will
you
send
Annie
to
me
here
Yes
sir
Thank
you
sir
How
did
you
know
that
Mrs
took
sleeping
powders
I
asked
in
lively
curiosity
as
Dorcas
left
the
room
And
about
the
lost
key
and
the
duplicate
One
thing
at
a
time
As
to
the
sleeping
powders
I
knew
by
this
He
suddenly
produced
a
small
cardboard
box
such
as
chemists
use
for
powders
Where
did
you
find
it
In
the
washstand
drawer
in
Mrs
bedroom
It
was
Number
Six
of
my
catalogue
But
I
suppose
as
the
last
powder
was
taken
two
days
ago
it
is
not
of
much
importance
Probably
not
but
do
you
notice
anything
that
strikes
you
as
peculiar
about
this
box
I
examined
it
closely
No
I
cant
say
that
I
do
Look
at
the
label
I
read
the
label
carefully
powder
to
be
taken
at
bedtime
if
required
Mrs
No
I
see
nothing
unusual
Not
the
fact
that
there
is
no
chemists
name
Ah
I
exclaimed
To
be
sure
that
is
odd
Have
you
ever
known
a
chemist
to
send
out
a
box
like
that
without
his
printed
name
No
I
cant
say
that
I
have
I
was
becoming
quite
excited
but
my
ardour
by
remarking
Yet
the
explanation
is
quite
do
not
intrigue
yourself
my
friend
An
audible
creaking
proclaimed
the
approach
of
Annie
so
I
had
no
time
to
reply
Annie
was
a
fine
strapping
girl
and
was
evidently
under
intense
excitement
mingled
with
a
certain
ghoulish
enjoyment
of
the
tragedy
came
to
the
point
at
once
with
a
businesslike
I
sent
for
you
Annie
because
I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
something
about
the
letters
Mrs
wrote
last
night
How
many
were
there
And
can
you
tell
me
any
of
the
names
and
addresses
Annie
considered
There
were
four
letters
sir
One
was
to
Miss
and
one
was
to
Mr
Wells
the
lawyer
and
the
other
two
I
dont
think
I
remember
yes
one
was
to
the
caterers
in
The
other
one
I
dont
remember
Think
urged
Annie
racked
her
brains
in
vain
Im
sorry
sir
but
its
clean
gone
I
dont
think
I
can
have
noticed
it
It
does
not
matter
said
not
betraying
any
sign
of
disappointment
Now
I
want
to
ask
you
about
something
else
There
is
a
saucepan
in
Mrs
room
with
some
cocoa
in
it
Did
she
have
that
every
night
Yes
sir
it
was
put
in
her
room
every
evening
and
she
warmed
it
up
in
the
she
fancied
it
What
was
it
Plain
cocoa
Yes
sir
made
with
milk
with
a
teaspoonful
of
sugar
and
two
of
rum
in
it
Who
took
it
to
her
room
I
did
sir
Always
Yes
sir
At
what
time
When
I
went
to
draw
the
curtains
as
a
rule
sir
Did
you
bring
it
straight
up
from
the
kitchen
then
No
sir
you
see
theres
not
much
room
on
the
gas
stove
so
Cook
used
to
make
it
early
before
putting
the
vegetables
on
for
supper
Then
I
used
to
bring
it
up
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
swing
door
and
take
it
into
her
room
later
The
swing
door
is
in
the
left
wing
is
it
not
Yes
sir
And
the
table
is
it
on
this
side
of
the
door
or
on
the
side
Its
this
side
sir
What
time
did
you
bring
it
up
last
night
About
seven
I
should
say
sir
And
when
did
you
take
it
into
Mrs
room
When
I
went
to
shut
up
sir
About
eight
oclock
Mrs
came
up
to
bed
before
Id
finished
Then
between
and
oclock
the
cocoa
was
standing
on
the
table
in
the
left
wing
Yes
sir
Annie
had
been
growing
redder
and
redder
in
the
face
and
now
she
blurted
out
unexpectedly
And
if
there
was
salt
in
it
sir
it
wasnt
me
I
never
took
the
salt
near
it
What
makes
you
think
there
was
salt
in
it
asked
Seeing
it
on
the
tray
sir
You
saw
some
salt
on
the
tray
Yes
Coarse
kitchen
salt
it
looked
I
never
noticed
it
when
I
took
the
tray
up
but
when
I
came
to
take
it
into
the
room
I
saw
it
at
once
and
I
suppose
I
ought
to
have
taken
it
down
again
and
asked
Cook
to
make
some
fresh
But
I
was
in
a
hurry
because
Dorcas
was
out
and
I
thought
maybe
the
cocoa
itself
was
all
right
and
the
salt
had
only
gone
on
the
tray
So
I
dusted
it
off
with
my
apron
and
took
it
in
I
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
controlling
my
excitement
Unknown
to
herself
Annie
had
provided
us
with
an
important
piece
of
evidence
How
she
would
have
if
she
had
realized
that
her
coarse
kitchen
salt
was
strychnine
one
of
the
most
deadly
poisons
known
to
mankind
I
marvelled
at
calm
His
was
astonishing
I
awaited
his
next
question
with
impatience
but
it
disappointed
me
When
you
went
into
Mrs
room
was
the
door
leading
into
Miss
room
bolted
Oh
Yes
sir
it
always
was
It
had
never
been
opened
And
the
door
into
Mr
room
Did
you
notice
if
that
was
bolted
too
Annie
hesitated
I
couldnt
rightly
say
sir
it
was
shut
but
I
couldnt
say
whether
it
was
bolted
or
not
When
you
finally
left
the
room
did
Mrs
bolt
the
door
after
you
No
sir
not
then
but
I
expect
she
did
later
She
usually
did
lock
it
at
night
The
door
into
the
passage
that
is
Did
you
notice
any
candle
grease
on
the
floor
when
you
did
the
room
yesterday
Candle
grease
Oh
no
sir
Mrs
didnt
have
a
candle
only
a
Then
if
there
had
been
a
large
patch
of
candle
grease
on
the
floor
you
think
you
would
have
been
sure
to
have
seen
it
Yes
sir
and
I
would
have
taken
it
out
with
a
piece
of
and
a
hot
iron
Then
repeated
the
question
he
had
put
to
Dorcas
Did
your
mistress
ever
have
a
green
dress
No
sir
Nor
a
mantle
nor
a
cape
nor
do
you
call
ita
sports
coat
Not
green
sir
Nor
anyone
else
in
the
house
Annie
reflected
No
sir
You
are
sure
of
that
Quite
sure
Bien
That
is
all
I
want
to
know
Thank
you
very
much
With
a
nervous
giggle
Annie
took
herself
out
of
the
room
My
excitement
burst
forth
I
cried
I
congratulate
you
This
is
a
great
discovery
What
is
a
great
discovery
Why
that
it
was
the
cocoa
and
not
the
coffee
that
was
poisoned
That
explains
everything
Of
course
it
did
not
take
effect
until
the
early
morning
since
the
cocoa
was
only
drunk
in
the
middle
of
the
night
So
you
think
that
the
well
what
I
say
Hastings
the
strychnine
Of
course
That
salt
on
the
tray
what
else
could
it
have
been
It
might
have
been
salt
replied
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
If
he
was
going
to
take
the
matter
that
way
it
was
no
good
arguing
with
him
The
idea
crossed
my
mind
not
for
the
first
time
that
poor
old
was
growing
old
Privately
I
thought
it
lucky
that
he
had
associated
with
him
some
one
of
a
more
receptive
type
of
mind
was
surveying
me
with
quietly
twinkling
eyes
You
are
not
pleased
with
me
mon
ami
My
dear
I
said
coldly
it
is
not
for
me
to
dictate
to
you
You
have
a
right
to
your
own
opinion
just
as
I
have
to
mine
A
most
admirable
sentiment
remarked
rising
briskly
to
his
feet
Now
I
have
finished
with
this
room
By
the
way
whose
is
the
smaller
desk
in
the
corner
Mr
Ah
He
tried
the
roll
top
tentatively
Locked
But
perhaps
one
of
Mrs
keys
would
open
it
He
tried
several
twisting
and
turning
them
with
a
practiced
hand
and
finally
uttering
an
ejaculation
of
satisfaction
Voila
It
is
not
the
key
but
it
will
open
it
at
a
pinch
He
slid
back
the
roll
top
and
ran
a
rapid
eye
over
the
neatly
filed
papers
To
my
surprise
he
did
not
examine
them
merely
remarking
as
he
the
desk
Decidedly
he
is
a
man
of
method
this
Mr
A
man
of
method
was
in
estimation
the
highest
praise
that
could
be
bestowed
on
any
individual
I
felt
that
my
friend
was
not
what
he
had
been
as
he
rambled
on
There
were
no
stamps
in
his
desk
but
there
might
have
been
eh
mon
ami
There
might
have
been
eyes
wandered
round
the
boudoir
has
nothing
more
to
tell
us
It
did
not
yield
much
Only
this
He
pulled
a
crumpled
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
over
to
me
It
was
rather
a
curious
document
A
plain
dirty
looking
old
envelope
with
a
few
words
scrawled
across
it
apparently
at
random
