There
was
a
moments
stupefied
silence
who
was
the
least
surprised
of
any
of
us
was
the
first
to
speak
My
word
he
cried
youre
the
goods
And
no
mistake
Mr
These
witnesses
of
yours
are
all
right
I
suppose
Voila
I
have
prepared
a
list
of
and
addresses
You
must
see
them
of
course
But
you
will
find
it
all
right
Im
sure
of
that
lowered
his
voice
Im
much
obliged
to
you
A
pretty
mares
nest
arresting
him
would
have
been
He
turned
to
But
if
excuse
me
sir
why
couldnt
you
say
all
this
at
the
inquest
I
will
tell
you
why
interrupted
There
was
a
certain
rumour
A
most
malicious
and
utterly
untrue
one
interrupted
Alfred
in
an
agitated
voice
And
Mr
was
anxious
to
have
no
scandal
revived
just
at
present
Am
I
right
Quite
right
nodded
With
my
poor
Emily
not
yet
buried
can
you
wonder
I
was
anxious
that
no
more
lying
rumours
should
be
started
Between
you
and
me
sir
remarked
Id
sooner
have
any
amount
of
rumours
than
be
arrested
for
murder
And
I
venture
to
think
your
poor
lady
would
have
felt
the
same
And
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Mr
here
arrested
you
would
have
been
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
I
was
foolish
no
doubt
murmured
But
you
do
not
know
inspector
how
I
have
been
persecuted
and
maligned
And
he
shot
a
baleful
glance
at
Now
sir
said
turning
briskly
to
John
I
should
like
to
see
the
bedroom
please
and
after
that
Ill
have
a
little
chat
with
the
servants
Dont
you
bother
about
anything
Mr
here
will
show
me
the
way
As
they
all
went
out
of
the
room
turned
and
made
me
a
sign
to
follow
him
upstairs
There
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
aside
Quick
go
to
the
other
wing
Stand
this
side
of
the
door
Do
not
move
till
I
come
Then
turning
rapidly
he
rejoined
the
two
detectives
I
followed
his
instructions
taking
up
my
position
by
the
door
and
wondering
what
on
earth
lay
behind
the
request
Why
was
I
to
stand
in
this
particular
spot
on
guard
I
looked
thoughtfully
down
the
corridor
in
front
of
me
An
idea
struck
me
With
the
exception
of
Cynthia
every
ones
room
was
in
this
left
wing
Had
that
anything
to
do
with
it
Was
I
to
report
who
came
or
went
I
stood
faithfully
at
my
post
The
minutes
passed
Nobody
came
Nothing
happened
It
must
have
been
quite
twenty
minutes
before
rejoined
me
You
have
not
stirred
No
Ive
stuck
here
like
a
rock
Nothings
happened
Ah
Was
he
pleased
or
disappointed
Youve
seen
nothing
at
all
No
But
you
have
probably
heard
something
A
big
mon
ami
No
Is
it
possible
Ah
but
I
am
vexed
with
myself
I
am
not
usually
clumsy
I
made
but
a
slight
know
the
left
hand
and
over
went
the
table
by
the
bed
He
looked
so
childishly
vexed
and
crestfallen
that
I
hastened
to
console
him
Never
mind
old
chap
What
does
it
matter
Your
triumph
downstairs
excited
you
I
can
tell
you
that
was
a
surprise
to
us
all
There
must
be
more
in
this
affair
of
with
Mrs
than
we
thought
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
so
persistently
What
are
you
going
to
do
now
Where
are
the
Scotland
Yard
fellows
Gone
down
to
interview
the
servants
I
showed
them
all
our
exhibits
I
am
disappointed
in
He
has
no
method
Hullo
I
said
looking
out
of
the
window
Heres
Dr
I
believe
youre
right
about
that
man
I
dont
like
him
He
is
clever
observed
Oh
clever
as
the
devil
I
must
say
I
was
overjoyed
to
see
him
in
the
plight
he
was
in
on
Tuesday
You
never
saw
such
a
spectacle
And
I
described
the
doctors
adventure
He
looked
a
regular
scarecrow
Plastered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
You
saw
him
then
Yes
Of
course
he
didnt
want
to
come
init
was
just
after
Mr
insisted
What
caught
me
violently
by
the
shoulders
Was
Dr
here
on
Tuesday
evening
Here
And
you
never
told
me
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
Why
Why
He
appeared
to
be
in
an
absolute
frenzy
My
dear
I
I
never
thought
it
would
interest
you
I
didnt
know
it
was
of
any
importance
Importance
It
is
of
the
first
importance
So
was
here
on
Tuesday
night
of
the
murder
Hastings
do
you
not
see
That
alters
I
had
never
seen
him
so
upset
Loosening
his
hold
of
me
he
mechanically
straightened
a
pair
of
candlesticks
still
murmuring
to
himself
Yes
that
alters
Suddenly
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
he
said
We
must
act
at
once
Where
is
Mr
Cavendish
John
was
in
the
went
straight
to
him
Mr
Cavendish
I
have
some
important
business
in
A
new
clue
May
I
take
your
motor
Why
of
course
Do
you
mean
at
once
If
you
please
John
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
round
the
car
In
another
ten
minutes
we
were
racing
down
the
park
and
along
the
high
road
to
Now
I
remarked
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
all
this
is
about
Well
mon
ami
a
good
deal
you
can
guess
for
yourself
Of
course
you
realize
that
now
Mr
is
out
of
it
the
whole
position
is
greatly
changed
We
are
face
to
face
with
an
entirely
new
problem
We
know
now
that
there
is
one
person
who
did
not
buy
the
poison
We
have
cleared
away
the
manufactured
clues
Now
for
the
real
ones
I
have
ascertained
that
anyone
in
the
household
with
the
exception
of
Mrs
Cavendish
who
was
playing
tennis
with
you
could
have
Mr
on
Monday
evening
In
the
same
way
we
have
his
statement
that
he
put
the
coffee
down
in
the
hall
No
one
took
much
notice
of
that
at
the
now
it
has
a
very
different
significance
We
must
find
out
who
did
take
that
coffee
to
Mrs
eventually
or
who
passed
through
the
hall
whilst
it
was
standing
there
From
your
account
there
are
only
two
people
whom
we
can
positively
say
did
not
go
near
the
Cavendish
and
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
Yes
that
is
so
I
felt
an
inexpressible
lightening
of
the
heart
Mary
Cavendish
could
certainly
not
rest
under
suspicion
In
clearing
Alfred
continued
I
have
been
obliged
to
show
my
hand
sooner
than
I
intended
As
long
as
I
might
be
thought
to
be
pursuing
him
the
criminal
would
be
off
his
guard
Now
he
will
be
doubly
careful
careful
He
turned
to
me
abruptly
Tell
me
Hastings
you
you
no
suspicions
of
anybody
I
hesitated
To
tell
the
truth
an
idea
wild
and
extravagant
in
itself
had
once
or
twice
that
morning
flashed
through
my
brain
I
had
rejected
it
as
absurd
nevertheless
it
persisted
You
couldnt
call
it
a
suspicion
I
murmured
Its
so
utterly
foolish
Come
now
urged
Do
not
fear
Speak
your
mind
You
should
always
pay
attention
to
your
instincts
Well
then
I
blurted
out
its
I
suspect
Miss
of
not
telling
all
she
knows
Miss
laugh
at
me
Not
at
all
Why
should
I
I
cant
help
feeling
I
continued
that
weve
rather
left
her
out
of
the
possible
suspects
simply
on
the
strength
of
her
having
been
away
from
the
place
But
after
all
she
was
only
fifteen
miles
away
A
car
would
do
it
in
half
an
hour
Can
we
say
positively
that
she
was
away
from
Styles
on
the
night
of
the
murder
Yes
my
friend
said
unexpectedly
we
can
One
of
my
first
actions
was
to
ring
up
the
hospital
where
she
was
working
Well
Well
I
learnt
that
Miss
had
been
on
afternoon
duty
on
Tuesday
and
convoy
coming
in
had
kindly
offered
to
remain
on
night
duty
which
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
That
disposes
of
that
Oh
I
said
rather
nonplussed
Really
I
continued
its
her
extraordinary
against
that
started
me
off
suspecting
her
I
cant
help
feeling
shed
do
anything
against
him
And
I
had
an
idea
she
might
know
something
about
the
destroying
of
the
will
She
might
have
burnt
the
new
one
mistaking
it
for
the
earlier
one
in
his
favour
She
is
so
terribly
bitter
against
him
You
consider
her
unnatural
Yes
She
is
so
very
violent
I
wondered
really
whether
she
is
quite
sane
on
that
point
shook
his
head
energetically
No
no
you
are
on
a
wrong
track
there
There
is
nothing
or
degenerate
about
Miss
She
is
an
excellent
specimen
of
English
beef
and
brawn
She
is
sanity
itself
Yet
her
hatred
of
seems
almost
a
mania
My
idea
very
ridiculous
one
no
she
had
intended
to
poison
that
in
some
way
Mrs
got
hold
of
it
by
mistake
But
I
dont
at
all
see
how
it
could
have
been
done
The
whole
thing
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
to
the
last
degree
Still
you
are
right
in
one
thing
It
is
always
wise
to
suspect
everybody
until
you
can
prove
logically
and
to
your
own
satisfaction
that
they
are
innocent
Now
what
reasons
are
there
against
Miss
having
deliberately
poisoned
Mrs
Why
she
was
devoted
to
her
I
exclaimed
cried
You
argue
like
a
child
If
Miss
were
capable
of
poisoning
the
old
lady
she
would
be
quite
equally
capable
of
simulating
devotion
No
we
must
look
elsewhere
You
are
perfectly
correct
in
your
assumption
that
her
against
Alfred
is
too
violent
to
be
natural
but
you
are
quite
wrong
in
the
deduction
you
draw
from
it
I
have
drawn
my
own
deductions
which
I
believe
to
be
correct
but
I
will
not
speak
of
them
at
present
He
paused
a
minute
then
went
on
Now
to
my
way
of
thinking
there
is
one
insuperable
objection
to
Miss
being
the
murderess
And
that
is
That
in
no
possible
way
could
Mrs
death
benefit
Miss
Now
there
is
no
murder
without
a
motive
I
reflected
Could
not
Mrs
have
made
a
will
in
her
favour
shook
his
head
But
you
yourself
suggested
that
possibility
to
Mr
Wells
smiled
That
was
for
a
reason
I
did
not
want
to
mention
the
name
of
the
person
who
was
actually
in
my
mind
Miss
occupied
very
much
the
same
position
so
I
used
her
name
instead
Still
Mrs
might
have
done
so
Why
that
will
made
on
the
afternoon
of
her
death
may
But
shake
of
the
head
was
so
energetic
that
I
stopped
No
my
friend
I
have
certain
little
ideas
of
my
own
about
that
will
But
I
can
tell
you
this
was
not
in
Miss
favour
I
accepted
his
assurance
though
I
did
not
really
see
how
he
could
be
so
positive
about
the
matter
Well
I
said
with
a
sigh
we
will
acquit
Miss
then
It
is
partly
your
fault
that
I
ever
came
to
suspect
her
It
was
what
you
said
about
her
evidence
at
the
inquest
that
set
me
off
looked
puzzled
What
did
I
say
about
her
evidence
at
the
inquest
Dont
you
remember
When
I
cited
her
and
John
Cavendish
as
being
above
suspicion
He
seemed
a
little
confused
but
recovered
himself
By
the
way
Hastings
there
is
something
I
want
you
to
do
for
me
Certainly
What
is
it
Next
time
you
happen
to
be
alone
with
Lawrence
Cavendish
I
want
you
to
say
this
to
him
I
have
a
message
for
you
from
He
says
Find
the
extra
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
Nothing
more
Nothing
less
Find
the
extra
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
Is
that
right
I
asked
much
mystified
Excellent
But
what
does
it
mean
Ah
that
I
will
leave
you
to
find
out
You
have
access
to
the
facts
Just
say
that
to
him
and
see
what
he
says
Very
its
all
extremely
mysterious
We
were
running
into
now
and
directed
the
car
to
the
Analytical
Chemist
hopped
down
briskly
and
went
inside
In
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
again
There
he
said
That
is
all
my
business
What
were
you
doing
there
I
asked
in
lively
curiosity
I
left
something
to
be
analysed
Yes
but
what
The
sample
of
cocoa
I
took
from
the
saucepan
in
the
bedroom
But
that
has
already
been
tested
I
cried
stupefied
Dr
had
it
tested
and
you
yourself
laughed
at
the
possibility
of
there
being
strychnine
in
it
I
know
Dr
had
it
tested
replied
quietly
Well
then
Well
I
have
a
fancy
for
having
it
analysed
again
that
is
all
And
not
another
word
on
the
subject
could
I
drag
out
of
him
This
proceeding
of
in
respect
of
the
cocoa
puzzled
me
intensely
I
could
see
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
in
it
However
my
confidence
in
him
which
at
one
time
had
rather
waned
was
fully
restored
since
his
belief
in
Alfred
innocence
had
been
so
triumphantly
vindicated
The
funeral
of
Mrs
took
place
the
following
day
and
on
Monday
as
I
came
down
to
a
late
breakfast
John
drew
me
aside
and
informed
me
that
Mr
was
leaving
that
morning
to
take
up
his
quarters
at
the
Arms
until
he
should
have
completed
his
plans
And
really
its
a
great
relief
to
think
hes
going
Hastings
continued
my
honest
friend
It
was
bad
enough
before
when
we
thought
hed
done
it
but
Im
hanged
if
it
isnt
worse
now
when
we
all
feel
guilty
for
having
been
so
down
on
the
fellow
The
fact
is
weve
treated
him
abominably
Of
course
things
did
look
black
against
him
I
dont
see
how
anyone
could
blame
us
for
jumping
to
the
conclusions
we
did
Still
there
it
is
we
were
in
the
wrong
and
now
theres
a
beastly
feeling
that
one
ought
to
make
amends
which
is
difficult
when
one
doesnt
like
the
fellow
a
bit
better
than
one
did
before
The
whole
things
damned
awkward
And
Im
thankful
hes
had
the
tact
to
take
himself
off
Its
a
good
thing
Styles
wasnt
the
to
leave
to
him
Couldnt
bear
to
think
of
the
fellow
lording
it
here
Hes
welcome
to
her
money
be
able
to
keep
up
the
place
all
right
I
asked
Oh
yes
There
are
the
death
duties
of
course
but
half
my
fathers
money
goes
with
the
place
and
Lawrence
will
stay
with
us
for
the
present
so
there
is
his
share
as
well
We
shall
be
pinched
at
first
of
course
because
as
I
once
told
you
I
am
in
a
bit
of
a
hole
financially
myself
Still
the
Johnnies
will
wait
now
In
the
general
relief
at
approaching
departure
we
had
the
most
genial
breakfast
we
had
experienced
since
the
tragedy
Cynthia
whose
young
spirits
were
naturally
buoyant
was
looking
quite
her
pretty
self
again
and
we
all
with
the
exception
of
Lawrence
who
seemed
unalterably
gloomy
and
nervous
were
quietly
cheerful
at
the
opening
of
a
new
and
hopeful
future
The
papers
of
course
had
been
full
of
the
tragedy
Glaring
headlines
sandwiched
biographies
of
every
member
of
the
household
subtle
innuendoes
the
usual
familiar
tag
about
the
police
having
a
clue
Nothing
was
spared
us
It
was
a
slack
time
The
war
was
momentarily
inactive
and
the
newspapers
seized
with
on
this
crime
in
fashionable
life
The
Mysterious
Affair
at
Styles
was
the
topic
of
the
moment
Naturally
it
was
very
annoying
for
the
The
house
was
constantly
besieged
by
reporters
who
were
consistently
denied
admission
but
who
continued
to
haunt
the
village
and
the
grounds
where
they
lay
in
wait
with
cameras
for
any
unwary
members
of
the
household
We
all
lived
in
a
blast
of
publicity
The
Scotland
Yard
men
came
and
went
examining
questioning
and
reserved
of
tongue
Towards
what
end
they
were
working
we
did
not
know
Had
they
any
clue
or
would
the
whole
thing
remain
in
the
category
of
undiscovered
crimes
After
breakfast
Dorcas
came
up
to
me
rather
mysteriously
and
asked
if
she
might
have
a
few
words
with
me
Certainly
What
is
it
Dorcas
Well
its
just
this
sir
be
seeing
the
Belgian
gentleman
today
perhaps
I
nodded
Well
sir
you
know
how
he
asked
me
so
particular
if
the
mistress
or
anyone
else
had
a
green
dress
Yes
yes
You
have
found
one
My
interest
was
aroused
No
not
that
sir
But
since
then
Ive
remembered
what
the
young
gentlemen
John
and
Lawrence
were
still
the
young
gentlemen
to
Dorcas
call
the
box
Its
up
in
the
front
attic
sir
A
great
chest
full
of
old
clothes
and
fancy
dresses
and
what
not
And
it
came
to
me
sudden
like
that
there
might
be
a
green
dress
amongst
them
So
if
youd
tell
the
Belgian
gentleman
I
will
tell
him
Dorcas
I
promised
Thank
you
very
much
sir
A
very
nice
gentleman
he
is
sir
And
quite
a
different
class
from
them
two
detectives
from
London
what
goes
prying
about
and
asking
questions
I
dont
hold
with
foreigners
as
a
rule
but
from
what
the
newspapers
say
I
make
out
as
how
these
brave
isnt
the
ordinary
run
of
foreigners
and
certainly
hes
a
most
polite
spoken
gentleman
Dear
old
Dorcas
As
she
stood
there
with
her
honest
face
upturned
to
mine
I
thought
what
a
fine
specimen
she
was
of
the
servant
that
is
so
fast
dying
out
I
thought
I
might
as
well
go
down
to
the
village
at
once
and
look
up
but
I
met
him
halfway
coming
up
to
the
house
and
at
once
gave
him
message
Ah
the
brave
Dorcas
We
will
look
at
the
chest
no
will
examine
it
all
the
same
We
entered
the
house
by
one
of
the
windows
There
was
no
one
in
the
hall
and
we
went
straight
up
to
the
attic
Sure
enough
there
was
the
chest
a
fine
old
piece
all
studded
with
brass
nails
and
full
to
overflowing
with
every
imaginable
type
of
garment
bundled
everything
out
on
the
floor
with
scant
ceremony
There
were
one
or
two
green
fabrics
of
varying
shades
but
shook
his
head
over
them
all
He
seemed
somewhat
apathetic
in
the
search
as
though
he
expected
no
great
results
from
it
Suddenly
he
gave
an
exclamation
What
is
it
Look
The
chest
was
nearly
empty
and
there
reposing
right
at
the
bottom
was
a
magnificent
black
beard
Oho
said
Oho
He
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
examining
it
closely
New
he
remarked
Yes
quite
new
After
a
moments
hesitation
he
replaced
it
in
the
chest
heaped
all
the
other
things
on
top
of
it
as
before
and
made
his
way
briskly
downstairs
He
went
straight
to
the
pantry
where
we
found
Dorcas
busily
polishing
her
silver
wished
her
good
morning
with
Gallic
politeness
and
went
on
We
have
been
looking
through
that
chest
Dorcas
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
mentioning
it
There
is
indeed
a
fine
collection
there
Are
they
often
used
may
I
ask
Well
sir
not
very
often
nowadays
though
from
time
to
time
we
do
have
what
the
young
gentlemen
call
a
night
And
very
funny
it
is
sometimes
sir
Mr
Lawrence
hes
wonderful
Most
comic
I
shall
never
forget
the
night
he
came
down
as
the
Char
of
Persia
I
think
he
called
ita
sort
of
Eastern
King
it
was
He
had
the
big
paper
knife
in
his
hand
and
Mind
Dorcas
he
says
have
to
be
very
respectful
This
is
my
specially
sharpened
scimitar
and
its
off
with
your
head
if
Im
at
all
displeased
with
you
Miss
Cynthia
she
was
what
they
call
an
Apache
or
some
such
sort
of
cutthroat
I
take
it
to
be
A
real
sight
she
looked
Youd
never
have
believed
a
pretty
young
lady
like
that
could
have
made
herself
into
such
a
ruffian
Nobody
would
have
known
her
These
evenings
must
have
been
great
fun
said
I
suppose
Mr
Lawrence
wore
that
fine
black
beard
in
the
chest
upstairs
when
he
was
Shah
of
Persia
He
did
have
a
beard
sir
replied
Dorcas
smiling
And
well
I
know
it
for
he
borrowed
two
skeins
of
my
black
wool
to
make
it
with
And
Im
sure
it
looked
wonderfully
natural
at
a
distance
I
didnt
know
as
there
was
a
beard
up
there
at
all
It
must
have
been
got
quite
lately
I
think
There
was
a
red
wig
I
know
but
nothing
else
in
the
way
of
hair
Burnt
corks
they
use
tis
messy
getting
it
off
again
Miss
Cynthia
was
a
nigger
once
and
oh
the
trouble
she
had
So
Dorcas
knows
nothing
about
that
black
beard
said
thoughtfully
as
we
walked
out
into
the
hall
again
Do
you
think
it
is
the
one
I
whispered
eagerly
nodded
I
do
You
notice
it
had
been
trimmed
No
Yes
It
was
cut
exactly
the
shape
of
Mr
and
I
found
one
or
two
snipped
hairs
Hastings
this
affair
is
very
deep
Who
put
it
in
the
chest
I
wonder
Some
one
with
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
remarked
You
realize
that
he
chose
the
one
place
in
the
house
to
hide
it
where
its
presence
would
not
be
remarked
Yes
he
is
intelligent
But
we
must
be
more
intelligent
We
must
be
so
intelligent
that
he
does
not
suspect
us
of
being
intelligent
at
all
I
acquiesced
There
mon
ami
you
will
be
of
great
assistance
to
me
I
was
pleased
with
the
compliment
There
had
been
times
when
I
hardly
thought
that
appreciated
me
at
my
true
worth
Yes
he
continued
staring
at
me
thoughtfully
you
will
be
invaluable
This
was
naturally
gratifying
but
next
words
were
not
so
welcome
I
must
have
an
ally
in
the
house
he
observed
reflectively
You
have
me
I
protested
True
but
you
are
not
sufficient
I
was
hurt
and
showed
it
hurried
to
explain
himself
You
do
not
quite
take
my
meaning
You
are
known
to
be
working
with
me
I
want
somebody
who
is
not
associated
with
us
in
any
way
Oh
I
see
How
about
John
No
I
think
not
The
dear
fellow
isnt
perhaps
very
bright
I
said
thoughtfully
Here
comes
Miss
said
suddenly
She
is
the
very
person
But
I
am
in
her
black
books
since
I
cleared
Mr
Still
we
can
but
try
With
a
nod
that
was
barely
civil
Miss
to
request
for
a
few
minutes
conversation
We
went
into
the
little
and
closed
the
door
Well
Monsieur
said
Miss
impatiently
what
is
it
Out
with
it
Im
busy
Do
you
remember
mademoiselle
that
I
once
asked
you
to
help
me
Yes
I
do
The
lady
nodded
And
I
told
you
Id
help
you
with
hang
Alfred
Ah
studied
her
seriously
Miss
I
will
ask
you
one
question
I
beg
of
you
to
reply
to
it
truthfully
Never
tell
lies
replied
Miss
It
is
this
Do
you
still
believe
that
Mrs
was
poisoned
by
her
husband
What
do
you
mean
she
asked
sharply
You
think
your
pretty
explanations
influence
me
in
the
slightest
Ill
admit
that
it
wasnt
he
who
bought
strychnine
at
the
chemists
shop
What
of
that
I
dare
say
he
soaked
fly
paper
as
I
told
you
at
the
beginning
That
is
strychnine
said
mildly
What
does
that
matter
Arsenic
would
put
poor
Emily
out
of
the
way
just
as
well
as
strychnine
If
Im
convinced
he
did
it
it
doesnt
matter
a
jot
to
me
how
he
did
it
Exactly
If
you
are
convinced
he
did
it
said
quietly
I
will
put
my
question
in
another
form
Did
you
ever
in
your
heart
of
hearts
believe
that
Mrs
was
poisoned
by
her
husband
Good
heavens
cried
Miss
Havent
I
always
told
you
the
man
is
a
villain
Havent
I
always
told
you
he
would
murder
her
in
her
bed
Havent
I
always
hated
him
like
poison
Exactly
said
That
bears
out
my
little
idea
entirely
What
little
idea
Miss
do
you
remember
a
conversation
that
took
place
on
the
day
of
my
friends
arrival
here
He
repeated
it
to
me
and
there
is
a
sentence
of
yours
that
has
impressed
me
very
much
Do
you
remember
affirming
that
if
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
anyone
you
loved
had
been
murdered
you
felt
certain
that
you
would
know
by
instinct
who
the
criminal
was
even
if
you
were
quite
unable
to
prove
it
Yes
I
remember
saying
that
I
believe
it
too
I
suppose
you
think
it
nonsense
Not
at
all
And
yet
you
will
pay
no
attention
to
my
instinct
against
Alfred
No
said
Because
your
instinct
is
not
against
Mr
What
No
You
wish
to
believe
he
committed
the
crime
You
believe
him
capable
of
committing
it
But
your
instinct
tells
you
he
did
not
commit
it
It
tells
you
I
go
on
She
was
staring
at
him
fascinated
and
made
a
slight
affirmative
movement
of
the
hand
Shall
I
tell
you
why
you
have
been
so
vehement
against
Mr
It
is
because
you
have
been
trying
to
believe
what
you
wish
to
believe
It
is
because
you
are
trying
to
drown
and
stifle
your
instinct
which
tells
you
another
name
No
no
no
cried
Miss
wildly
flinging
up
her
hands
Dont
say
it
Oh
dont
say
it
It
isnt
true
It
cant
be
true
I
dont
know
what
put
such
a
a
into
my
head
I
am
right
am
I
not
asked
Yes
yes
you
must
be
a
wizard
to
have
guessed
But
it
cant
be
too
monstrous
too
impossible
It
must
be
Alfred
shook
his
head
gravely
Dont
ask
me
about
it
continued
Miss
because
I
shant
tell
you
I
wont
admit
it
even
to
myself
I
must
be
mad
to
think
of
such
a
thing
nodded
as
if
satisfied
I
will
ask
you
nothing
It
is
enough
for
me
that
it
is
as
I
thought
And
II
too
have
an
instinct
We
are
working
together
towards
a
common
end
Dont
ask
me
to
help
you
because
I
wont
I
wouldnt
lift
a
finger
toto
She
faltered
You
will
help
me
in
spite
of
yourself
I
ask
you
you
will
be
my
ally
You
will
not
be
able
to
help
yourself
You
will
do
the
only
thing
that
I
want
of
you
And
that
is
You
will
watch
bowed
her
head
Yes
I
cant
help
doing
that
I
am
always
hoping
I
shall
be
proved
wrong
If
we
are
wrong
well
and
good
said
No
one
will
be
more
pleased
than
I
shall
But
if
we
are
right
If
we
are
right
Miss
on
whose
side
are
you
then
I
dont
know
I
dont
know
Come
now
It
could
be
hushed
up
There
must
be
no
hushing
up
But
Emily
herself
She
broke
off
Miss
said
gravely
this
is
unworthy
of
you
Suddenly
she
took
her
face
from
her
hands
Yes
she
said
quietly
that
was
not
who
spoke
She
flung
her
head
up
proudly
This
is
And
she
is
on
the
side
of
Justice
Let
the
cost
be
what
it
may
And
with
these
words
she
walked
firmly
out
of
the
room
There
said
looking
after
her
goes
a
very
valuable
ally
That
woman
Hastings
has
got
brains
as
well
as
a
heart
I
did
not
reply
Instinct
is
a
marvellous
thing
mused
It
can
neither
be
explained
nor
ignored
You
and
Miss
seem
to
know
what
you
are
talking
about
I
observed
coldly
Perhaps
you
dont
realize
that
I
am
still
in
the
dark
Really
Is
that
so
mon
ami
Yes
Enlighten
me
will
you
studied
me
attentively
for
a
moment
or
two
Then
to
my
intense
surprise
he
shook
his
head
decidedly
No
my
friend
Oh
look
here
why
not
Two
is
enough
for
a
secret
Well
I
think
it
is
very
unfair
to
keep
back
facts
from
me
I
am
not
keeping
back
facts
Every
fact
that
I
know
is
in
your
possession
You
can
draw
your
own
deductions
from
them
This
time
it
is
a
question
of
ideas
Still
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
and
again
shook
his
head
You
see
he
said
sadly
you
have
no
instincts
It
was
intelligence
you
were
requiring
just
now
I
pointed
out
The
two
often
go
together
said
The
remark
seemed
so
utterly
irrelevant
that
I
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
answer
it
But
I
decided
that
if
I
made
any
interesting
and
important
no
doubt
I
would
keep
them
to
myself
and
surprise
with
the
ultimate
result
There
are
times
when
it
is
ones
duty
to
assert
oneself
I
had
had
no
opportunity
as
yet
of
passing
on
message
to
Lawrence
But
now
as
I
strolled
out
on
the
lawn
still
nursing
a
grudge
against
my
friends
I
saw
Lawrence
on
the
croquet
lawn
aimlessly
knocking
a
couple
of
very
ancient
balls
about
with
a
still
more
ancient
mallet
It
struck
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
deliver
my
message
Otherwise
himself
might
relieve
me
of
it
It
was
true
that
I
did
not
quite
gather
its
purport
but
I
flattered
myself
that
by
reply
and
perhaps
a
little
skillful
on
my
part
I
should
soon
perceive
its
significance
Accordingly
I
accosted
him
Ive
been
looking
for
you
I
remarked
Have
you
Yes
The
truth
is
Ive
got
a
message
for
Yes
He
told
me
to
wait
until
I
was
alone
with
you
I
said
dropping
my
voice
significantly
and
watching
him
intently
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
I
have
always
been
rather
good
at
what
is
called
I
believe
creating
an
atmosphere
Well
There
was
no
change
of
expression
in
the
dark
melancholic
face
Had
he
any
idea
of
what
I
was
about
to
say
This
is
the
message
I
dropped
my
voice
still
lower
Find
the
extra
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
What
on
earth
does
he
mean
Lawrence
stared
at
me
in
quite
unaffected
astonishment
Dont
you
know
Not
in
the
least
Do
you
I
was
compelled
to
shake
my
head
What
extra
I
dont
know
Hed
better
ask
Dorcas
or
one
of
the
maids
if
he
wants
to
know
about
Its
their
business
not
mine
I
dont
know
anything
about
the
except
that
weve
got
some
that
are
never
used
which
are
a
perfect
dream
Old
Worcester
Youre
not
a
connoisseur
are
you
Hastings
I
shook
my
head
You
miss
a
lot
A
really
perfect
bit
of
old
pure
delight
to
handle
it
or
even
to
look
at
it
Well
what
am
I
to
tell
Tell
him
I
dont
know
what
hes
talking
about
Its
double
Dutch
to
me
All
right
I
was
moving
off
towards
the
house
again
when
he
suddenly
called
me
back
I
say
what
was
the
end
of
that
message
Say
it
over
again
will
you
Find
the
extra
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
Are
you
sure
you
dont
know
what
it
means
I
asked
him
earnestly
He
shook
his
head
No
he
said
I
dont
II
wish
I
did
The
boom
of
the
gong
sounded
from
the
house
and
we
went
in
together
had
been
asked
by
John
to
remain
to
lunch
and
was
already
seated
at
the
table
By
tacit
consent
all
mention
of
the
tragedy
was
barred
We
conversed
on
the
war
and
other
outside
topics
But
after
the
cheese
and
biscuits
had
been
handed
round
and
Dorcas
had
left
the
room
suddenly
leant
forward
to
Mrs
Cavendish
Pardon
me
madame
for
recalling
unpleasant
memories
but
I
have
a
little
little
ideas
were
becoming
a
perfect
would
like
to
ask
one
or
two
questions
Of
me
Certainly
You
are
too
amiable
madame
What
I
want
to
ask
is
this
the
door
leading
into
Mrs
room
from
that
of
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
it
was
bolted
you
say
Certainly
it
was
bolted
replied
Mary
Cavendish
rather
said
so
at
the
inquest
Bolted
Yes
She
looked
perplexed
I
mean
explained
you
are
sure
it
was
bolted
and
not
merely
locked
Oh
I
see
what
you
mean
No
I
dont
know
I
said
bolted
meaning
that
it
was
fastened
and
I
could
not
open
it
but
I
believe
all
the
doors
were
found
bolted
on
the
inside
Still
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
the
door
might
equally
well
have
been
locked
Oh
yes
You
yourself
did
not
happen
to
notice
madame
when
you
entered
Mrs
room
whether
that
door
was
bolted
or
not
II
believe
it
was
But
you
did
not
see
it
No
looked
But
I
did
interrupted
Lawrence
suddenly
I
happened
to
notice
that
it
was
bolted
Ah
that
settles
it
And
looked
crestfallen
I
could
not
help
rejoicing
that
for
once
one
of
his
little
ideas
had
come
to
naught
After
lunch
begged
me
to
accompany
him
home
I
consented
rather
stiffly
You
are
annoyed
is
it
not
so
he
asked
anxiously
as
we
walked
through
the
park
Not
at
all
I
said
coldly
That
is
well
That
lifts
a
great
load
from
my
mind
This
was
not
quite
what
I
had
intended
I
had
hoped
that
he
would
have
observed
the
stiffness
of
my
manner
Still
the
fervour
of
his
words
went
towards
the
appeasing
of
my
just
displeasure
I
thawed
I
gave
Lawrence
your
message
I
said
And
what
did
he
say
He
was
entirely
puzzled
Yes
I
am
quite
sure
he
had
no
idea
of
what
you
meant
I
had
expected
to
be
disappointed
but
to
my
surprise
he
replied
that
that
was
as
he
had
thought
and
that
he
was
very
glad
My
pride
forbade
me
to
ask
any
questions
switched
off
on
another
tack
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
was
not
at
lunch
today
How
was
that
She
is
at
the
hospital
again
She
resumed
work
today
Ah
she
is
an
industrious
little
And
pretty
too
She
is
like
pictures
I
have
seen
in
Italy
I
would
rather
like
to
see
that
dispensary
of
hers
Do
you
think
she
would
show
it
to
me
I
am
sure
she
would
be
delighted
Its
an
interesting
little
place
Does
she
go
there
every
day
She
has
all
Wednesdays
off
and
comes
back
to
lunch
on
Saturdays
Those
are
her
only
times
off
I
will
remember
Women
are
doing
great
work
nowadays
and
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
is
yes
she
has
brains
that
little
one
Yes
I
believe
she
has
passed
quite
a
stiff
exam
Without
doubt
After
all
it
is
very
responsible
work
I
suppose
they
have
very
strong
poisons
there
Yes
she
showed
them
to
us
They
are
kept
locked
up
in
a
little
cupboard
I
believe
they
have
to
be
very
careful
They
always
take
out
the
key
before
leaving
the
room
Indeed
It
is
near
the
window
this
cupboard
No
right
the
other
side
of
the
room
Why
shrugged
his
shoulders
I
wondered
That
is
all
Will
you
come
in
We
had
reached
the
cottage
No
I
think
Ill
be
getting
back
I
shall
go
round
the
long
way
through
the
woods
The
woods
round
Styles
were
very
beautiful
After
the
walk
across
the
open
park
it
was
pleasant
to
saunter
through
the
cool
glades
There
was
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
the
very
chirp
of
the
birds
was
faint
and
subdued
I
strolled
on
a
little
way
and
finally
flung
myself
down
at
the
foot
of
a
grand
old
My
thoughts
of
mankind
were
kindly
and
charitable
I
even
forgave
for
his
absurd
secrecy
In
fact
I
was
at
peace
with
the
world
Then
I
yawned
I
thought
about
the
crime
and
it
struck
me
as
being
very
unreal
and
far
off
I
yawned
again
Probably
I
thought
it
really
never
happened
Of
course
it
was
all
a
bad
dream
The
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
it
was
Lawrence
who
had
murdered
Alfred
with
a
croquet
mallet
But
it
was
absurd
of
John
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
and
to
go
shouting
out
I
tell
you
I
wont
have
it
I
woke
up
with
a
start
At
once
I
realized
that
I
was
in
a
very
awkward
predicament
For
about
twelve
feet
away
from
me
John
and
Mary
Cavendish
were
standing
facing
each
other
and
they
were
evidently
quarrelling
And
quite
as
evidently
they
were
unaware
of
my
vicinity
for
before
I
could
move
or
speak
John
repeated
the
words
which
had
aroused
me
from
my
dream
I
tell
you
Mary
I
wont
have
it
Marys
voice
came
cool
and
liquid
Have
you
any
right
to
criticize
my
actions
It
will
be
the
talk
of
the
village
My
mother
was
only
buried
on
Saturday
and
here
you
are
gadding
about
with
the
fellow
Oh
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
if
it
is
only
village
gossip
that
you
mind
But
it
isnt
Ive
had
enough
of
the
fellow
hanging
about
Hes
a
Polish
Jew
anyway
A
tinge
of
Jewish
blood
is
not
a
bad
thing
It
leavens
looked
at
stupidity
of
the
ordinary
Englishman
Fire
in
her
eyes
ice
in
her
voice
I
did
not
wonder
that
the
blood
rose
to
Johns
face
in
a
crimson
tide
Mary
Well
Her
tone
did
not
change
The
pleading
died
out
of
his
voice
Am
I
to
understand
that
you
will
continue
to
see
against
my
express
wishes
If
I
choose
You
defy
me
No
but
I
deny
your
right
to
criticize
my
actions
Have
you
no
friends
of
whom
I
should
disapprove
John
fell
back
a
colour
ebbed
slowly
from
his
face
What
do
you
mean
he
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
You
see
said
Mary
quietly
You
do
see
dont
you
that
you
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
me
as
to
the
choice
of
my
friends
John
glanced
at
her
a
stricken
look
on
his
face
No
right
Have
I
no
right
Mary
he
said
unsteadily
He
stretched
out
his
hands
Mary
For
a
moment
I
thought
she
wavered
A
softer
expression
came
over
her
face
then
suddenly
she
turned
almost
fiercely
away
nan
She
was
walking
away
when
John
sprang
after
her
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
voice
was
very
quiet
you
in
love
with
this
fellow
She
hesitated
and
suddenly
there
swept
across
her
face
a
strange
expression
old
as
the
hills
yet
with
something
eternally
young
about
it
So
might
some
Egyptian
sphinx
have
smiled
She
freed
herself
quietly
from
his
arm
and
spoke
over
her
shoulder
Perhaps
she
said
and
then
swiftly
passed
out
of
the
little
glade
leaving
John
standing
there
as
though
he
had
been
turned
to
stone
Rather
ostentatiously
I
stepped
forward
crackling
some
dead
branches
with
my
feet
as
I
did
so
John
turned
Luckily
he
took
it
for
granted
that
I
had
only
just
come
upon
the
scene
Hullo
Hastings
Have
you
seen
the
little
fellow
safely
back
to
his
cottage
Quaint
little
chap
Is
he
any
good
though
really
He
was
considered
one
of
the
finest
detectives
of
his
day
Oh
well
I
suppose
there
must
be
something
in
it
then
What
a
rotten
world
it
is
though
You
find
it
so
I
asked
Good
Lord
yes
Theres
this
terrible
business
to
start
with
Scotland
Yard
men
in
and
out
of
the
house
like
a
Never
know
where
they
wont
turn
up
next
Screaming
headlines
in
every
paper
in
the
all
journalists
I
say
Do
you
know
there
was
a
whole
crowd
staring
in
at
the
lodge
gates
this
morning
Sort
of
Madame
chamber
of
horrors
business
that
can
be
seen
for
nothing
Pretty
thick
isnt
it
Cheer
up
John
I
said
soothingly
It
cant
last
for
ever
Cant
it
though
It
can
last
long
enough
for
us
never
to
be
able
to
hold
up
our
heads
again
No
no
youre
getting
morbid
on
the
subject
Enough
to
make
a
man
morbid
to
be
stalked
by
beastly
journalists
and
stared
at
by
gaping
idiots
wherever
he
goes
But
theres
worse
than
that
What
John
lowered
his
voice
Have
you
ever
thought
a
nightmare
to
did
it
I
cant
help
feeling
sometimes
it
must
have
been
an
accident
could
have
done
it
Now
out
of
the
way
theres
no
one
else
no
one
I
mean
of
us
Yes
indeed
that
was
nightmare
enough
for
any
man
One
of
us
Yes
surely
it
must
be
so
unless
A
new
idea
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
Rapidly
I
considered
it
The
light
increased
mysterious
doings
his
all
fitted
in
Fool
that
I
was
not
to
have
thought
of
this
possibility
before
and
what
a
relief
for
us
all
No
John
I
said
it
isnt
one
of
us
How
could
it
be
I
know
but
still
who
else
is
there
Cant
you
guess
No
I
looked
cautiously
round
and
lowered
my
voice
Dr
I
whispered
Impossible
Not
at
all
But
what
earthly
interest
could
he
have
in
my
mothers
death
That
I
dont
see
I
confessed
but
Ill
tell
you
this
thinks
so
Does
he
How
do
you
know
I
told
him
of
intense
excitement
on
hearing
that
Dr
had
been
at
Styles
on
the
fatal
night
and
added
He
said
twice
That
alters
everything
And
Ive
been
thinking
You
know
said
he
had
put
down
the
coffee
in
the
hall
Well
it
was
just
then
that
arrived
Isnt
it
possible
that
as
brought
him
through
the
hall
the
doctor
dropped
something
into
the
coffee
in
passing
Hm
said
John
It
would
have
been
very
risky
Yes
but
it
was
possible
And
then
how
could
he
know
it
was
her
coffee
No
old
fellow
I
dont
think
that
will
wash
But
I
had
remembered
something
else
Youre
quite
right
That
wasnt
how
it
was
done
Listen
And
I
then
told
him
of
the
cocoa
sample
which
had
taken
to
be
analysed
John
interrupted
just
as
I
had
done
But
look
here
had
had
it
analysed
already
Yes
yes
thats
the
point
I
didnt
see
it
either
until
now
Dont
you
understand
had
it
just
it
If
the
murderer
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
for
him
to
substitute
some
ordinary
cocoa
for
his
sample
and
send
that
to
be
tested
And
of
course
they
would
find
no
strychnine
But
no
one
would
dream
of
suspecting
or
think
of
taking
another
I
added
with
belated
recognition
Yes
but
what
about
the
bitter
taste
that
cocoa
wont
disguise
Well
weve
only
his
word
for
that
And
there
are
other
possibilities
Hes
admittedly
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
toxicologists
One
of
the
worlds
greatest
what
Say
it
again
He
knows
more
about
poisons
than
almost
anybody
I
explained
Well
my
idea
is
that
perhaps
hes
found
some
way
of
making
strychnine
tasteless
Or
it
may
not
have
been
strychnine
at
all
but
some
obscure
drug
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
which
produces
much
the
same
symptoms
Hm
yes
that
might
be
said
John
But
look
here
how
could
he
have
got
at
the
cocoa
That
wasnt
downstairs
No
it
wasnt
I
admitted
reluctantly
And
then
suddenly
a
dreadful
possibility
flashed
through
my
mind
I
hoped
and
prayed
it
would
not
occur
to
John
also
I
glanced
sideways
at
him
He
was
frowning
and
I
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
for
the
terrible
thought
that
had
flashed
across
my
mind
was
this
that
Dr
might
have
had
an
accomplice
Yet
surely
it
could
not
be
Surely
no
woman
as
beautiful
as
Mary
Cavendish
could
be
a
murderess
Yet
beautiful
women
had
been
known
to
poison
And
suddenly
I
remembered
that
first
conversation
at
tea
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
and
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
as
she
had
said
that
poison
was
a
womans
weapon
How
agitated
she
had
been
on
that
fatal
Tuesday
evening
Had
Mrs
discovered
something
between
her
and
and
threatened
to
tell
her
husband
Was
it
to
stop
that
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
Then
I
remembered
that
enigmatical
conversation
between
and
Was
this
what
they
had
meant
Was
this
the
monstrous
possibility
that
had
tried
not
to
believe
Yes
it
all
fitted
in
No
wonder
Miss
had
suggested
hushing
it
up
Now
I
understood
that
unfinished
sentence
of
hers
Emily
herself
And
in
my
heart
I
agreed
with
her
Would
not
Mrs
have
preferred
to
go
unavenged
rather
than
have
such
terrible
dishonour
fall
upon
the
name
of
Cavendish
Theres
another
thing
said
John
suddenly
and
the
unexpected
sound
of
his
voice
made
me
start
Something
which
makes
me
doubt
if
what
you
say
can
be
true
Whats
that
I
asked
thankful
that
he
had
gone
away
from
the
subject
of
how
the
poison
could
have
been
introduced
into
the
cocoa
Why
the
fact
that
demanded
a
postmortem
He
have
done
so
Little
would
have
been
quite
content
to
let
it
go
at
heart
disease
Yes
I
said
doubtfully
But
we
dont
know
Perhaps
he
thought
it
safer
in
the
long
run
Some
one
might
have
talked
afterwards
Then
the
Home
Office
might
have
ordered
exhumation
The
whole
thing
would
have
come
out
then
and
he
would
have
been
in
an
awkward
position
for
no
one
would
have
believed
that
a
man
of
his
reputation
could
have
been
deceived
into
calling
it
heart
disease
Yes
thats
possible
admitted
John
Still
he
added
Im
blest
if
I
can
see
what
his
motive
could
have
been
I
trembled
Look
here
I
said
I
may
be
altogether
wrong
And
remember
all
this
is
in
confidence
Oh
of
goes
without
saying
We
had
walked
as
we
talked
and
now
we
passed
through
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
Voices
rose
near
at
hand
for
tea
was
spread
out
under
the
as
it
had
been
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
Cynthia
was
back
from
the
hospital
and
I
placed
my
chair
beside
her
and
told
her
of
wish
to
visit
the
dispensary
Of
course
Id
love
him
to
see
it
Hed
better
come
to
tea
there
one
day
I
must
fix
it
up
with
him
Hes
such
a
dear
little
man
But
he
is
funny
He
made
me
take
the
brooch
out
of
my
tie
the
other
day
and
put
it
in
again
because
he
said
it
wasnt
straight
I
laughed
Its
quite
a
mania
with
him
Yes
isnt
it
We
were
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
glancing
in
the
direction
of
Mary
Cavendish
and
dropping
her
voice
Cynthia
said
Mr
Hastings
Yes
After
tea
I
want
to
talk
to
you
Her
glance
at
Mary
had
set
me
thinking
I
fancied
that
between
these
two
there
existed
very
little
sympathy
For
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
about
the
girls
future
Mrs
had
made
no
provisions
of
any
kind
for
her
but
I
imagined
that
John
and
Mary
would
probably
insist
on
her
making
her
home
with
any
rate
until
the
end
of
the
war
John
I
knew
was
very
fond
of
her
and
would
be
sorry
to
let
her
go
John
who
had
gone
into
the
house
now
reappeared
His
face
wore
an
unaccustomed
frown
of
anger
Confound
those
detectives
I
cant
think
what
theyre
after
Theyve
been
in
every
room
in
the
things
inside
out
and
upside
down
It
really
is
too
bad
I
suppose
they
took
advantage
of
our
all
being
out
I
shall
go
for
that
fellow
when
I
next
see
him
Lot
of
Paul
grunted
Miss
Lawrence
that
they
had
to
make
a
show
of
doing
something
Mary
Cavendish
said
nothing
After
tea
I
invited
Cynthia
to
come
for
a
walk
and
we
sauntered
off
into
the
woods
together
Well
I
inquired
as
soon
as
we
were
protected
from
prying
eyes
by
the
leafy
screen
With
a
sigh
Cynthia
flung
herself
down
and
tossed
off
her
hat
The
sunlight
piercing
through
the
branches
turned
the
auburn
of
her
hair
to
quivering
gold
Mr
are
always
so
kind
and
you
know
such
a
lot
It
struck
me
at
this
moment
that
Cynthia
was
really
a
very
charming
girl
Much
more
charming
than
Mary
who
never
said
things
of
that
kind
Well
I
asked
as
she
hesitated
I
want
to
ask
your
advice
What
shall
I
do
Do
Yes
You
see
Aunt
Emily
always
told
me
I
should
be
provided
for
I
suppose
she
forgot
or
didnt
think
she
was
likely
to
I
am
not
provided
for
And
I
dont
know
what
to
do
Do
you
think
I
ought
to
go
away
from
here
at
once
Good
heavens
no
They
dont
want
to
part
with
you
Im
sure
Cynthia
hesitated
a
moment
plucking
up
the
grass
with
her
tiny
hands
Then
she
said
Mrs
Cavendish
does
She
hates
me
Hates
you
I
cried
astonished
Cynthia
nodded
Yes
I
dont
know
why
but
she
cant
bear
me
and
he
cant
either
There
I
know
youre
wrong
I
said
warmly
On
the
contrary
John
is
very
fond
of
you
Oh
I
meant
Lawrence
Not
of
course
that
I
care
whether
Lawrence
hates
me
or
not
Still
its
rather
horrid
when
no
one
loves
you
isnt
it
But
they
do
Cynthia
dear
I
said
earnestly
Im
sure
you
are
mistaken
Look
there
is
Miss
Cynthia
nodded
rather
Yes
John
likes
me
I
think
and
of
course
for
all
her
gruff
ways
wouldnt
be
unkind
to
a
fly
But
Lawrence
never
speaks
to
me
if
he
can
help
it
and
Mary
can
hardly
bring
herself
to
be
civil
to
me
She
wants
to
stay
on
is
begging
her
to
but
she
doesnt
want
me
dont
know
what
to
do
Suddenly
the
poor
child
burst
out
crying
I
dont
know
what
possessed
me
Her
beauty
perhaps
as
she
sat
there
with
the
sunlight
glinting
down
on
her
head
perhaps
the
sense
of
relief
at
encountering
someone
who
so
obviously
could
have
no
connection
with
the
tragedy
perhaps
honest
pity
for
her
youth
and
loneliness
Anyway
I
leant
forward
and
taking
her
little
hand
I
said
awkwardly
Marry
me
Cynthia
Unwittingly
I
had
hit
upon
a
sovereign
remedy
for
her
tears
She
sat
up
at
once
drew
her
hand
away
and
said
with
some
Dont
be
silly
I
was
a
little
annoyed
Im
not
being
silly
I
am
asking
you
to
do
me
the
honour
of
becoming
my
wife
To
my
intense
surprise
Cynthia
burst
out
laughing
and
called
me
a
funny
dear
Its
perfectly
sweet
of
you
she
said
but
you
know
you
dont
want
to
Yes
I
do
Ive
got
Never
mind
what
youve
got
You
dont
really
want
I
dont
either
Well
of
course
that
settles
it
I
said
stiffly
But
I
dont
see
anything
to
laugh
at
Theres
nothing
funny
about
a
proposal
No
indeed
said
Cynthia
Somebody
might
accept
you
next
time
Goodbye
youve
cheered
me
up
very
much
And
with
a
final
uncontrollable
burst
of
merriment
she
vanished
through
the
trees
Thinking
over
the
interview
it
struck
me
as
being
profoundly
unsatisfactory
It
occurred
to
me
suddenly
that
I
would
go
down
to
the
village
and
look
up
Somebody
ought
to
be
keeping
an
eye
on
the
fellow
At
the
same
time
it
would
be
wise
to
allay
any
suspicions
he
might
have
as
to
his
being
suspected
I
remembered
how
had
relied
on
my
diplomacy
Accordingly
I
went
to
the
little
house
with
the
Apartments
card
inserted
in
the
window
where
I
knew
he
lodged
and
tapped
on
the
door
An
old
woman
came
and
opened
it
Good
afternoon
I
said
pleasantly
Is
Dr
in
She
stared
at
me
Havent
you
heard
Heard
what
About
him
What
about
him
Hes
took
Took
Dead
No
took
by
the
By
the
police
I
gasped
Do
you
mean
theyve
arrested
him
Yes
thats
it
and
I
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
tore
up
the
village
to
find
To
my
extreme
annoyance
was
not
in
and
the
old
Belgian
who
answered
my
knock
informed
me
that
he
believed
he
had
gone
to
London
I
was
dumbfounded
What
on
earth
could
be
doing
in
London
Was
it
a
sudden
decision
on
his
part
or
had
he
already
made
up
his
mind
when
he
parted
from
me
a
few
hours
earlier
I
retraced
my
steps
to
Styles
in
some
annoyance
With
away
I
was
uncertain
how
to
act
Had
he
foreseen
this
arrest
Had
he
not
in
all
probability
been
the
cause
of
it
Those
questions
I
could
not
resolve
But
in
the
meantime
what
was
I
to
do
Should
I
announce
the
arrest
openly
at
Styles
or
not
Though
I
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
myself
the
thought
of
Mary
Cavendish
was
weighing
on
me
Would
it
not
be
a
terrible
shock
to
her
For
the
moment
I
set
aside
utterly
any
suspicions
of
her
She
could
not
be
I
should
have
heard
some
hint
of
it
Of
course
there
was
no
possibility
of
being
able
permanently
to
conceal
Dr
arrest
from
her
It
would
be
announced
in
every
newspaper
on
the
morrow
Still
I
shrank
from
blurting
it
out
If
only
Poirot
had
been
accessible
I
could
have
asked
his
advice
What
possessed
him
to
go
posting
off
to
London
in
this
unaccountable
way
In
spite
of
myself
my
opinion
of
his
sagacity
was
immeasurably
heightened
I
would
never
have
dreamt
of
suspecting
the
doctor
had
not
Poirot
put
it
into
my
head
Yes
decidedly
the
little
man
was
clever
After
some
reflecting
I
decided
to
take
John
into
my
confidence
and
leave
him
to
make
the
matter
public
or
not
as
he
thought
fit
He
gave
vent
to
a
prodigious
whistle
as
I
imparted
the
news
Great
Scot
You
were
right
then
I
couldnt
believe
it
at
the
time
No
it
is
astonishing
until
you
get
used
to
the
idea
and
see
how
it
makes
everything
fit
in
Now
what
are
we
to
do
Of
course
it
will
be
generally
known
tomorrow
John
reflected
Never
mind
he
said
at
last
we
wont
say
anything
at
present
There
is
no
need
As
you
say
it
will
be
known
soon
enough
But
to
my
intense
surprise
on
getting
down
early
the
next
morning
and
eagerly
opening
the
newspapers
there
was
not
a
word
about
the
arrest
There
was
a
column
of
mere
padding
about
The
Styles
Poisoning
Case
but
nothing
further
It
was
rather
inexplicable
but
I
supposed
that
for
some
reason
or
other
wished
to
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
It
worried
me
just
a
little
for
it
suggested
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
further
arrests
to
come
After
breakfast
I
decided
to
go
down
to
the
village
and
see
if
had
returned
yet
but
before
I
could
start
a
face
blocked
one
of
the
windows
and
the
voice
said
Bon
jour
mon
ami
I
exclaimed
with
relief
and
seizing
him
by
both
hands
I
dragged
him
into
the
room
I
was
never
so
glad
to
see
anyone
Listen
I
have
said
nothing
to
anybody
but
John
Is
that
right
My
friend
replied
I
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
Dr
arrest
of
course
I
answered
impatiently
Is
arrested
then
Did
you
not
know
it
Not
the
least
in
the
world
But
pausing
a
moment
he
added
Still
it
does
not
surprise
me
After
all
we
are
only
four
miles
from
the
coast
The
coast
I
asked
puzzled
What
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
shrugged
his
shoulders
Surely
it
is
obvious
Not
to
me
No
doubt
I
am
very
dense
but
I
cannot
see
what
the
proximity
of
the
coast
has
got
to
do
with
the
murder
of
Mrs
Nothing
at
all
of
course
replied
smiling
But
we
were
speaking
of
the
arrest
of
Dr
Well
he
is
arrested
for
the
murder
of
Mrs
What
cried
in
apparently
lively
astonishment
Dr
arrested
for
the
murder
of
Mrs
Yes
Impossible
That
would
be
too
good
a
farce
Who
told
you
that
my
friend
Well
no
one
exactly
told
me
I
confessed
But
he
is
arrested
Oh
yes
very
likely
But
for
espionage
mon
ami
Espionage
I
gasped
Precisely
Not
for
poisoning
Mrs
Not
unless
our
friend
has
taken
leave
of
his
senses
replied
I
thought
you
thought
so
too
gave
me
one
look
which
conveyed
a
wondering
pity
and
his
full
sense
of
the
utter
absurdity
of
such
an
idea
Do
you
mean
to
say
I
asked
slowly
adapting
myself
to
the
new
idea
that
Dr
is
a
spy
nodded
Have
you
never
suspected
it
It
never
entered
my
head
It
did
not
strike
you
as
peculiar
that
a
famous
London
doctor
should
bury
himself
in
a
little
village
like
this
and
should
be
in
the
habit
of
walking
about
at
all
hours
of
the
night
fully
dressed
No
I
confessed
I
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
He
is
of
course
a
German
by
birth
said
thoughtfully
though
he
has
practiced
so
long
in
this
country
that
nobody
thinks
of
him
as
anything
but
an
Englishman
He
was
naturalized
about
fifteen
years
ago
A
very
clever
mana
Jew
of
course
The
blackguard
I
cried
indignantly
Not
at
all
He
is
on
the
contrary
a
patriot
Think
what
he
stands
to
lose
I
admire
the
man
myself
But
I
could
not
look
at
it
in
philosophical
way
And
this
is
the
man
with
whom
Mrs
Cavendish
has
been
wandering
about
all
over
the
country
I
cried
indignantly
Yes
I
should
fancy
he
had
found
her
very
useful
remarked
So
long
as
gossip
busied
itself
in
coupling
their
names
together
any
other
vagaries
of
the
doctors
passed
unobserved
Then
you
think
he
never
really
cared
for
her
I
asked
too
eagerly
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
That
of
course
I
cannot
say
I
tell
you
my
own
private
opinion
Hastings
Yes
Well
it
is
this
that
Mrs
Cavendish
does
not
care
and
never
has
cared
one
little
jot
about
Dr
Do
you
really
think
so
I
could
not
disguise
my
pleasure
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
And
I
will
tell
you
why
Yes
Because
she
cares
for
some
one
else
mon
ami
Oh
What
did
he
mean
In
spite
of
myself
an
agreeable
warmth
spread
over
me
I
am
not
a
vain
man
where
women
are
concerned
but
I
remembered
certain
evidences
too
lightly
thought
of
at
the
time
perhaps
but
which
certainly
seemed
to
indicate
My
pleasing
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Miss
She
glanced
round
hastily
to
make
sure
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
and
quickly
produced
an
old
sheet
of
brown
paper
This
she
handed
to
murmuring
as
she
did
so
the
cryptic
words
On
top
of
the
wardrobe
Then
she
hurriedly
left
the
room
unfolded
the
sheet
of
paper
eagerly
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
He
spread
it
out
on
the
table
Come
here
Hastings
Now
tell
me
what
is
that
or
L
It
was
a
medium
sized
sheet
of
paper
rather
dusty
as
though
it
had
lain
by
for
some
time
But
it
was
the
label
that
was
attracting
attention
At
the
top
it
bore
the
printed
stamp
of
Messrs
the
theatrical
and
it
was
addressed
to
the
debatable
initial
Cavendish
Esq
Styles
Court
Styles
St
Mary
It
might
be
T
or
it
might
be
L
I
said
after
studying
the
thing
for
a
minute
or
two
It
certainly
isnt
a
J
Good
replied
folding
up
the
paper
again
I
also
am
of
your
way
of
thinking
It
is
an
L
depend
upon
it
Where
did
it
come
from
I
asked
curiously
Is
it
important
Moderately
so
It
confirms
a
surmise
of
mine
Having
deduced
its
existence
I
set
Miss
to
search
for
it
and
as
you
see
she
has
been
successful
What
did
she
mean
by
On
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
She
meant
replied
promptly
that
she
found
it
on
top
of
a
wardrobe
A
funny
place
for
a
piece
of
brown
paper
I
mused
Not
at
all
The
top
of
a
wardrobe
is
an
excellent
place
for
brown
paper
and
cardboard
boxes
I
have
kept
them
there
myself
Neatly
arranged
there
is
nothing
to
offend
the
eye
I
asked
earnestly
have
you
made
up
your
mind
about
this
crime
is
to
say
I
believe
I
know
how
it
was
committed
Ah
Unfortunately
I
have
no
proof
beyond
my
surmise
unless
With
sudden
energy
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
whirled
me
down
the
hall
calling
out
in
French
in
his
excitement
Mademoiselle
Dorcas
Mademoiselle
Dorcas
un
moment
sil
plait
Dorcas
quite
by
the
noise
came
hurrying
out
of
the
pantry
My
good
Dorcas
I
have
an
little
it
should
prove
justified
what
magnificent
chance
Tell
me
on
Monday
not
Tuesday
Dorcas
but
Monday
the
day
before
the
tragedy
did
anything
go
wrong
with
Mrs
bell
Dorcas
looked
very
surprised
Yes
sir
now
you
mention
it
it
did
though
I
dont
know
how
you
came
to
hear
of
it
A
mouse
or
some
such
must
have
nibbled
the
wire
through
The
man
came
and
put
it
right
on
Tuesday
morning
With
a
long
drawn
exclamation
of
ecstasy
led
the
way
back
to
the
See
you
one
should
not
ask
for
outside
reason
should
be
enough
But
the
flesh
is
weak
it
is
consolation
to
find
that
one
is
on
the
right
track
Ah
my
friend
I
am
like
a
giant
refreshed
I
run
I
leap
And
in
very
truth
run
and
leap
he
did
wildly
down
the
stretch
of
lawn
outside
the
long
window
What
is
your
remarkable
little
friend
doing
asked
a
voice
behind
me
and
I
turned
to
find
Mary
Cavendish
at
my
elbow
She
smiled
and
so
did
I
What
is
it
all
about
Really
I
cant
tell
you
He
asked
Dorcas
some
question
about
a
bell
and
appeared
so
delighted
with
her
answer
that
he
is
capering
about
as
you
see
Mary
laughed
How
ridiculous
Hes
going
out
of
the
gate
Isnt
he
coming
back
today
I
dont
know
Ive
given
up
trying
to
guess
what
hell
do
next
Is
he
quite
mad
Mr
Hastings
I
honestly
dont
know
Sometimes
I
feel
sure
he
is
as
mad
as
a
hatter
and
then
just
as
he
is
at
his
maddest
I
find
there
is
method
in
his
madness
I
see
In
spite
of
her
laugh
Mary
was
looking
thoughtful
this
morning
She
seemed
grave
almost
sad
It
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
tackle
her
on
the
subject
of
Cynthia
I
began
rather
tactfully
I
thought
but
I
had
not
gone
far
before
she
stopped
me
authoritatively
You
are
an
excellent
advocate
I
have
no
doubt
Mr
Hastings
but
in
this
case
your
talents
are
quite
thrown
away
Cynthia
will
run
no
risk
of
encountering
any
unkindness
from
me
I
began
to
stammer
feebly
that
I
hoped
she
hadnt
again
she
stopped
me
and
her
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
quite
drove
Cynthia
and
her
troubles
out
of
my
mind
Mr
Hastings
she
said
do
you
think
I
and
my
husband
are
happy
together
I
was
considerably
taken
aback
and
murmured
something
about
its
not
being
my
business
to
think
anything
of
the
sort
Well
she
said
quietly
whether
it
is
your
business
or
not
I
will
tell
you
that
we
are
not
happy
I
said
nothing
for
I
saw
that
she
had
not
finished
She
began
slowly
walking
up
and
down
the
room
her
head
a
little
bent
and
that
slim
supple
figure
of
hers
swaying
gently
as
she
walked
She
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
up
at
me
You
dont
know
anything
about
me
do
you
she
asked
Where
I
come
from
who
I
was
before
I
married
in
fact
Well
I
will
tell
you
I
will
make
a
father
confessor
of
you
You
are
kind
I
I
am
sure
you
are
kind
Somehow
I
was
not
quite
as
elated
as
I
might
have
been
I
remembered
that
Cynthia
had
begun
her
confidences
in
much
the
same
way
Besides
a
father
confessor
should
be
elderly
it
is
not
at
all
the
role
for
a
young
man
My
father
was
English
said
Mrs
Cavendish
but
my
mother
was
a
Russian
Ah
I
said
now
I
understand
Understand
what
A
hint
of
something
there
has
always
been
about
you
My
mother
was
very
beautiful
I
believe
I
dont
know
because
I
never
saw
her
She
died
when
I
was
quite
a
little
child
I
believe
there
was
some
tragedy
connected
with
her
took
an
overdose
of
some
sleeping
draught
by
mistake
However
that
may
be
my
father
was
brokenhearted
Shortly
afterwards
he
went
into
the
Consular
Service
Everywhere
he
went
I
went
with
him
When
I
was
I
had
been
nearly
all
over
the
world
It
was
a
splendid
loved
it
There
was
a
smile
on
her
face
and
her
head
was
thrown
back
She
seemed
living
in
the
memory
of
those
old
glad
days
Then
my
father
died
He
left
me
very
badly
off
I
had
to
go
and
live
with
some
old
aunts
in
Yorkshire
She
shuddered
You
will
understand
me
when
I
say
that
it
was
a
deadly
life
for
a
girl
brought
up
as
I
had
been
The
narrowness
the
deadly
monotony
of
it
almost
drove
me
mad
She
paused
a
minute
and
added
in
a
different
tone
And
then
I
met
John
Cavendish
Yes
You
can
imagine
that
from
my
aunts
point
of
view
it
was
a
very
good
match
for
me
But
I
can
honestly
say
it
was
not
this
fact
which
weighed
with
me
No
he
was
simply
a
way
of
escape
from
the
insufferable
monotony
of
my
life
I
said
nothing
and
after
a
moment
she
went
on
Dont
misunderstand
me
I
was
quite
honest
with
him
I
told
him
what
was
true
that
I
liked
him
very
much
that
I
hoped
to
come
to
like
him
more
but
that
I
was
not
in
any
way
what
the
world
calls
in
love
with
him
He
declared
that
that
satisfied
him
and
were
married
She
waited
a
long
time
a
little
frown
had
gathered
on
her
forehead
She
seemed
to
be
looking
back
earnestly
into
those
past
days
I
am
cared
for
me
at
first
But
I
suppose
we
were
not
well
matched
Almost
at
once
we
drifted
apart
is
not
a
pleasing
thing
for
my
pride
but
it
is
the
of
me
very
soon
I
must
have
made
some
murmur
of
dissent
for
she
went
on
quickly
Oh
yes
he
did
Not
that
it
matters
that
weve
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
What
do
you
mean
She
answered
quietly
I
mean
that
I
am
not
going
to
remain
at
Styles
You
and
John
are
not
going
to
live
here
John
may
live
here
but
I
shall
not
You
are
going
to
leave
him
Yes
But
why
She
paused
a
long
time
and
said
at
last
I
want
to
And
as
she
spoke
I
had
a
sudden
vision
of
broad
spaces
virgin
tracts
of
forests
a
realization
of
what
freedom
would
mean
to
such
a
nature
as
Mary
Cavendish
I
seemed
to
see
her
for
a
moment
as
she
was
a
proud
wild
creature
as
untamed
by
civilization
as
some
shy
bird
of
the
hills
A
little
cry
broke
from
her
lips
You
dont
know
you
dont
know
how
this
hateful
place
has
been
prison
to
me
I
understand
I
said
dont
do
anything
rash
Oh
rash
Her
voice
mocked
at
my
prudence
Then
suddenly
I
said
a
thing
I
could
have
bitten
out
my
tongue
for
You
know
that
Dr
has
been
arrested
An
instant
coldness
passed
like
a
mask
over
her
face
blotting
out
all
expression
John
was
so
kind
as
to
break
that
to
me
this
morning
Well
what
do
you
think
I
asked
feebly
Of
what
Of
the
arrest
What
should
I
think
Apparently
he
is
a
German
spy
so
the
gardener
had
told
John
Her
face
and
voice
were
absolutely
cold
and
expressionless
Did
she
care
or
did
she
not
She
moved
away
a
step
or
two
and
fingered
one
of
the
flower
vases
These
are
quite
dead
I
must
do
them
again
Would
you
mind
you
Mr
Hastings
And
she
walked
quietly
past
me
out
of
the
window
with
a
cool
little
nod
of
dismissal
No
surely
she
could
not
care
for
No
woman
could
act
her
part
with
that
icy
did
not
make
his
appearance
the
following
morning
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
Scotland
Yard
men
But
at
lunchtime
there
arrived
a
new
piece
of
rather
lack
of
evidence
We
had
vainly
tried
to
trace
the
fourth
letter
which
Mrs
had
written
on
the
evening
preceding
her
death
Our
efforts
having
been
in
vain
we
had
abandoned
the
matter
hoping
that
it
might
turn
up
of
itself
one
day
And
this
is
just
what
did
happen
in
the
shape
of
a
communication
which
arrived
by
the
second
post
from
a
firm
of
French
music
publishers
acknowledging
Mrs
cheque
and
regretting
they
had
been
unable
to
trace
a
certain
series
of
Russian
So
the
last
hope
of
solving
the
mystery
by
means
of
Mrs
correspondence
on
the
fatal
evening
had
to
be
abandoned
Just
before
tea
I
strolled
down
to
tell
of
the
new
disappointment
but
found
to
my
annoyance
that
he
was
once
more
out
Gone
to
London
again
Oh
no
monsieur
he
has
but
taken
the
train
to
To
see
a
young
dispensary
he
said
Silly
ass
I
ejaculated
I
told
him
Wednesday
was
the
one
day
she
wasnt
there
Well
tell
him
to
look
us
up
tomorrow
morning
will
you
Certainly
monsieur
But
on
the
following
day
no
sign
of
I
was
getting
angry
He
was
really
treating
us
in
the
most
cavalier
fashion
After
lunch
Lawrence
drew
me
aside
and
asked
if
I
was
going
down
to
see
him
No
I
dont
think
I
shall
He
can
come
up
here
if
he
wants
to
see
us
Oh
Lawrence
looked
indeterminate
Something
unusually
nervous
and
excited
in
his
manner
roused
my
curiosity
What
is
it
I
asked
I
could
go
if
theres
anything
special
Its
nothing
much
if
you
are
going
will
you
tell
him
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
think
Ive
found
the
extra
I
had
almost
forgotten
that
enigmatical
message
of
but
now
my
curiosity
was
aroused
afresh
Lawrence
would
say
no
more
so
I
decided
that
I
would
descend
from
my
high
horse
and
once
more
seek
out
at
Leastways
Cottage
This
time
I
was
received
with
a
smile
Monsieur
was
within
Would
I
mount
I
mounted
accordingly
was
sitting
by
the
table
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
He
sprang
up
at
my
entrance
What
is
it
I
asked
You
are
not
ill
I
trust
No
no
not
ill
But
I
decide
an
affair
of
great
moment
Whether
to
catch
the
criminal
or
not
I
asked
facetiously
But
to
my
great
surprise
nodded
gravely
To
speak
or
not
to
speak
as
your
so
great
Shakespeare
says
that
is
the
question
I
did
not
trouble
to
correct
the
quotation
You
are
not
serious
I
am
of
the
most
serious
For
the
most
serious
of
all
things
hangs
in
the
balance
And
that
is
A
womans
happiness
mon
ami
he
said
gravely
I
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
The
moment
has
come
said
thoughtfully
and
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
For
see
you
it
is
a
big
stake
for
which
I
play
No
one
but
I
would
attempt
it
And
he
tapped
himself
proudly
on
the
breast
After
pausing
a
few
minutes
respectfully
so
as
not
to
spoil
his
effect
I
gave
him
message
Aha
he
cried
So
he
has
found
the
extra
That
is
good
He
has
more
intelligence
than
would
appear
this
Monsieur
Lawrence
of
yours
I
did
not
myself
think
very
highly
of
intelligence
but
I
to
contradict
and
gently
took
him
to
task
for
forgetting
my
instructions
as
to
which
were
days
off
It
is
true
I
have
the
head
of
a
sieve
However
the
other
young
lady
was
most
kind
She
was
sorry
for
my
disappointment
and
showed
me
everything
in
the
kindest
way
Oh
well
thats
all
right
then
and
you
must
go
to
tea
with
Cynthia
another
day
I
told
him
about
the
letter
I
am
sorry
for
that
he
said
I
always
had
hopes
of
that
letter
But
no
it
was
not
to
be
This
affair
must
all
be
unravelled
from
within
He
tapped
his
forehead
These
little
grey
cells
It
is
up
to
you
say
over
here
Then
suddenly
he
asked
Are
you
a
judge
of
my
friend
No
I
said
rather
surprised
I
know
that
there
are
no
two
alike
but
thats
as
far
as
my
science
goes
Exactly
He
unlocked
a
little
drawer
and
took
out
some
photographs
which
he
laid
on
the
table
I
have
numbered
them
Will
you
describe
them
to
me
I
studied
the
proofs
attentively
All
greatly
magnified
I
see
No
I
should
say
are
a
mans
fingerprints
thumb
and
first
finger
No
are
a
they
are
much
smaller
and
quite
different
in
every
way
No
paused
for
some
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
confused
but
here
very
distinctly
are
No
Overlapping
the
others
Yes
You
recognize
them
beyond
fail
Oh
yes
they
are
identical
nodded
and
gently
taking
the
photographs
from
me
locked
them
up
again
I
suppose
I
said
that
as
usual
you
are
not
going
to
explain
On
the
contrary
No
were
the
fingerprints
of
Monsieur
Lawrence
No
were
those
of
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
They
are
not
important
I
merely
obtained
them
for
comparison
No
is
a
little
more
complicated
Yes
It
is
as
you
see
highly
magnified
You
may
have
noticed
a
sort
of
blur
extending
all
across
the
picture
I
will
not
describe
to
you
the
special
apparatus
dusting
powder
etc
which
I
used
It
is
a
process
to
the
police
and
by
means
of
it
you
can
obtain
a
photograph
of
the
fingerprints
of
any
object
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
Well
my
friend
you
have
seen
the
remains
to
tell
you
the
particular
object
on
which
they
had
been
left
Go
onI
am
really
excited
Eh
bien
Photo
No
represents
the
highly
magnified
surface
of
a
tiny
bottle
in
the
top
poison
cupboard
of
the
dispensary
in
the
Red
Cross
Hospital
at
sounds
like
the
house
that
Jack
built
Good
heavens
I
exclaimed
But
what
were
Lawrence
doing
on
it
He
never
went
near
the
poison
cupboard
the
day
we
were
there
Oh
yes
he
did
Impossible
We
were
all
together
the
whole
time
shook
his
head
No
my
friend
there
was
a
moment
when
you
were
not
all
together
There
was
a
moment
when
you
could
not
have
been
all
together
or
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
call
to
Monsieur
Lawrence
to
come
and
join
you
on
the
balcony
Id
forgotten
that
I
admitted
But
it
was
only
for
a
moment
Long
enough
Long
enough
for
what
smile
became
rather
enigmatical
Long
enough
for
a
gentleman
who
had
once
studied
medicine
to
gratify
a
very
natural
interest
and
curiosity
Our
eyes
met
were
pleasantly
vague
He
got
up
and
hummed
a
little
tune
I
watched
him
suspiciously
I
said
what
was
in
this
particular
little
bottle
looked
out
of
the
window
Hydrochloride
of
strychnine
he
said
over
his
shoulder
continuing
to
hum
Good
heavens
I
said
it
quite
quietly
I
was
not
surprised
I
had
expected
that
answer
They
use
the
pure
hydrochloride
of
strychnine
very
occasionally
for
pills
It
is
the
official
solution
Strychnine
that
is
used
in
most
medicines
That
is
why
the
have
remained
undisturbed
since
then
How
did
you
manage
to
take
this
photograph
I
dropped
my
hat
from
the
balcony
explained
simply
Visitors
were
not
permitted
below
at
that
hour
so
in
spite
of
my
many
apologies
Mademoiselle
colleague
had
to
go
down
and
fetch
it
for
me
Then
you
knew
what
you
were
going
to
find
No
not
at
all
I
merely
realized
that
it
was
possible
from
your
story
for
Monsieur
Lawrence
to
go
to
the
poison
cupboard
The
possibility
had
to
be
confirmed
or
eliminated
I
said
your
gaiety
does
not
deceive
me
This
is
a
very
important
discovery
I
do
not
know
said
But
one
thing
does
strike
me
No
doubt
it
has
struck
you
too
What
is
that
Why
that
there
is
altogether
too
much
strychnine
about
this
case
This
is
the
third
time
we
run
up
against
it
There
was
strychnine
in
Mrs
tonic
There
is
the
strychnine
sold
across
the
counter
at
Styles
St
Mary
by
Mace
Now
we
have
more
strychnine
handled
by
one
of
the
household
It
is
confusing
and
as
you
know
I
do
not
like
confusion
Before
I
could
reply
one
of
the
other
Belgians
opened
the
door
and
stuck
his
head
in
There
is
a
lady
below
asking
for
Mr
Hastings
A
lady
I
jumped
up
followed
me
down
the
narrow
stairs
Mary
Cavendish
was
standing
in
the
doorway
I
have
been
visiting
an
old
woman
in
the
village
she
explained
and
as
Lawrence
told
me
you
were
with
Monsieur
I
thought
I
would
call
for
you
Alas
madame
said
I
thought
you
had
come
to
honour
me
with
a
visit
I
will
some
day
if
you
ask
me
she
promised
him
smiling
That
is
well
If
you
should
need
a
father
confessor
madame
she
started
ever
so
Papa
is
always
at
your
service
She
stared
at
him
for
a
few
minutes
as
though
seeking
to
read
some
deeper
meaning
into
his
words
Then
she
turned
abruptly
away
Come
will
you
not
walk
back
with
us
too
Monsieur
Enchanted
madame
All
the
way
to
Styles
Mary
talked
fast
and
feverishly
It
struck
me
that
in
some
way
she
was
nervous
of
eyes
The
weather
had
broken
and
the
sharp
wind
was
almost
autumnal
in
its
shrewishness
Mary
shivered
a
little
and
buttoned
her
black
sports
coat
closer
The
wind
through
the
trees
made
a
mournful
noise
like
some
great
giant
sighing
We
walked
up
to
the
great
door
of
Styles
and
at
once
the
knowledge
came
to
us
that
something
was
wrong
Dorcas
came
running
out
to
meet
us
She
was
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
I
was
aware
of
other
servants
huddled
together
in
the
background
all
eyes
and
ears
Oh
mam
Oh
mam
I
dont
know
how
to
tell
you
What
is
it
Dorcas
I
asked
impatiently
Tell
us
at
once
Its
those
wicked
detectives
Theyve
arrested
arrested
Mr
Cavendish
Arrested
Lawrence
I
gasped
I
saw
a
strange
look
come
into
eyes
No
sir
Not
Mr
John
