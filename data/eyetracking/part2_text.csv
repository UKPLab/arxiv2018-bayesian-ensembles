Where
did
you
find
this
I
asked
in
lively
curiosity
In
the
wastepaper
wastepaper
basket
You
recognise
the
handwriting
Yes
it
is
Mrs
But
what
does
it
mean
shrugged
his
shoulders
I
cannot
it
is
suggestive
A
wild
idea
flashed
across
me
Was
it
possible
that
Mrs
mind
was
deranged
Had
she
some
fantastic
idea
of
demoniacal
possession
And
if
that
were
so
was
it
not
also
possible
that
she
might
have
taken
her
own
life
I
was
about
to
expound
these
theories
to
when
his
own
words
distracted
me
Come
he
said
now
to
examine
the
My
dear
What
on
earth
is
the
good
of
that
now
that
we
know
about
the
cocoa
Oh
la
la
That
miserable
cocoa
cried
flippantly
He
laughed
with
apparent
enjoyment
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
in
mock
despair
in
what
I
could
not
but
consider
the
worst
possible
taste
And
anyway
I
said
with
increasing
coldness
as
Mrs
took
her
coffee
upstairs
with
her
I
do
not
see
what
you
expect
to
find
unless
you
consider
it
likely
that
we
shall
discover
a
packet
of
strychnine
on
the
coffee
tray
was
sobered
at
once
Come
come
my
friend
he
said
slipping
his
arms
through
mine
Ne
pas
Allow
me
to
interest
myself
in
my
and
I
will
respect
your
cocoa
There
Is
it
a
bargain
He
was
so
quaintly
humorous
that
I
was
forced
to
laugh
and
we
went
together
to
the
where
the
and
tray
remained
undisturbed
as
we
had
left
them
made
me
recapitulate
the
scene
of
the
night
before
listening
very
carefully
and
verifying
the
position
of
the
various
cups
So
Mrs
Cavendish
stood
by
the
poured
out
Yes
Then
she
came
across
to
the
window
where
you
sat
with
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
Yes
Here
are
the
three
cups
And
the
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
half
drunk
that
would
be
Mr
Lawrence
And
the
one
on
the
tray
John
I
saw
him
put
it
down
there
Good
One
two
three
four
where
then
is
the
cup
of
Mr
He
does
not
take
coffee
Then
all
are
accounted
for
One
moment
my
friend
With
infinite
care
he
took
a
drop
or
two
from
the
grounds
in
each
cup
sealing
them
up
in
separate
test
tubes
tasting
each
in
turn
as
he
did
so
His
physiognomy
underwent
a
curious
change
An
expression
gathered
there
that
I
can
only
describe
as
half
puzzled
and
half
relieved
Bien
he
said
at
last
It
is
evident
I
had
an
clearly
I
was
mistaken
Yes
altogether
I
was
mistaken
Yet
it
is
strange
But
no
matter
And
with
a
characteristic
shrug
he
dismissed
whatever
it
was
that
was
worrying
him
from
his
mind
I
could
have
told
him
from
the
beginning
that
this
obsession
of
his
over
the
coffee
was
bound
to
end
in
a
blind
alley
but
I
restrained
my
tongue
After
all
though
he
was
old
had
been
a
great
man
in
his
day
Breakfast
is
ready
said
John
Cavendish
coming
in
from
the
hall
You
will
breakfast
with
us
Monsieur
acquiesced
I
observed
John
Already
he
was
almost
restored
to
his
normal
self
The
shock
of
the
events
of
the
last
night
had
upset
him
temporarily
but
his
poise
soon
swung
back
to
the
normal
He
was
a
man
of
very
little
imagination
in
sharp
contrast
with
his
brother
who
had
perhaps
too
much
Ever
since
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
John
had
been
hard
at
work
sending
of
the
first
had
gone
to
notices
for
the
papers
and
generally
occupying
himself
with
the
melancholy
duties
that
a
death
entails
May
I
ask
how
things
are
proceeding
he
said
Do
your
investigations
point
to
my
mother
having
died
a
natural
must
we
prepare
ourselves
for
the
worst
I
think
Mr
Cavendish
said
gravely
that
you
would
do
well
not
to
buoy
yourself
up
with
any
false
hopes
Can
you
tell
me
the
views
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
My
brother
Lawrence
is
convinced
that
we
are
making
a
fuss
over
nothing
He
says
that
everything
points
to
its
being
a
simple
case
of
heart
failure
He
does
does
he
That
is
very
interesting
murmured
softly
And
Mrs
Cavendish
A
faint
cloud
passed
over
Johns
face
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
my
wifes
views
on
the
subject
are
The
answer
brought
a
momentary
stiffness
in
its
train
John
broke
the
rather
awkward
silence
by
saying
with
a
slight
effort
I
told
you
didnt
I
that
Mr
has
returned
bent
his
head
Its
an
awkward
position
for
all
of
us
Of
course
one
has
to
treat
him
as
hang
it
all
ones
gorge
does
rise
at
sitting
down
to
eat
with
a
possible
murderer
nodded
sympathetically
I
quite
understand
It
is
a
very
difficult
situation
for
you
Mr
Cavendish
I
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
Mr
reason
for
not
returning
last
night
was
I
believe
that
he
had
forgotten
the
latchkey
Is
not
that
so
Yes
I
suppose
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
latchkey
was
he
did
not
take
it
after
all
I
have
no
idea
I
never
thought
of
looking
We
always
keep
it
in
the
hall
drawer
Ill
go
and
see
if
its
there
now
held
up
his
hand
with
a
faint
smile
No
no
Mr
Cavendish
it
is
too
late
now
I
am
certain
that
you
would
find
it
If
Mr
did
take
it
he
has
had
ample
time
to
replace
it
by
now
But
do
you
think
I
think
nothing
If
anyone
had
chanced
to
look
this
morning
before
his
return
and
seen
it
there
it
would
have
been
a
valuable
point
in
his
favour
That
is
all
John
looked
perplexed
Do
not
worry
said
smoothly
I
assure
you
that
you
need
not
let
it
trouble
you
Since
you
are
so
kind
let
us
go
and
have
some
breakfast
Every
one
was
assembled
in
the
Under
the
circumstances
we
were
naturally
not
a
cheerful
party
The
reaction
after
a
shock
is
always
trying
and
I
think
we
were
all
suffering
from
it
Decorum
and
good
breeding
naturally
enjoined
that
our
demeanour
should
be
much
as
usual
yet
I
could
not
help
wondering
if
this
were
really
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
There
were
no
red
eyes
no
signs
of
secretly
indulged
grief
I
felt
that
I
was
right
in
my
opinion
that
Dorcas
was
the
person
most
affected
by
the
personal
side
of
the
tragedy
I
pass
over
Alfred
who
acted
the
bereaved
widower
in
a
manner
that
I
felt
to
be
disgusting
in
its
hypocrisy
Did
he
know
that
we
suspected
him
I
wondered
Surely
he
could
not
be
unaware
of
the
fact
conceal
it
as
we
would
Did
he
feel
some
secret
stirring
of
fear
or
was
he
confident
that
his
crime
would
go
unpunished
Surely
the
suspicion
in
the
atmosphere
must
warn
him
that
he
was
already
a
marked
man
But
did
every
one
suspect
him
What
about
Mrs
Cavendish
I
watched
her
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
graceful
composed
enigmatic
In
her
soft
grey
frock
with
white
ruffles
at
the
wrists
falling
over
her
slender
hands
she
looked
very
beautiful
When
she
chose
however
her
face
could
be
in
its
She
was
very
silent
hardly
opening
her
lips
and
yet
in
some
queer
way
I
felt
that
the
great
strength
of
her
personality
was
dominating
us
all
And
little
Cynthia
Did
she
suspect
She
looked
very
tired
and
ill
I
thought
The
heaviness
and
languor
of
her
manner
were
very
marked
I
asked
her
if
she
were
feeling
ill
and
she
answered
frankly
Yes
Ive
got
the
most
beastly
headache
Have
another
cup
of
coffee
mademoiselle
said
It
will
revive
you
It
is
unparalleled
for
the
mal
de
tete
He
jumped
up
and
took
her
cup
No
sugar
said
Cynthia
watching
him
as
he
picked
up
the
No
sugar
You
abandon
it
in
the
wartime
eh
No
I
never
take
it
in
coffee
Sacre
murmured
to
himself
as
he
brought
back
the
replenished
cup
Only
I
heard
him
and
glancing
up
curiously
at
the
little
man
I
saw
that
his
face
was
working
with
suppressed
excitement
and
his
eyes
were
as
green
as
a
cats
He
had
heard
or
seen
something
that
had
affected
him
what
was
it
I
do
not
usually
label
myself
as
dense
but
I
must
confess
that
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
attracted
my
attention
In
another
moment
the
door
opened
and
Dorcas
appeared
Mr
Wells
to
see
you
sir
she
said
to
John
I
remembered
the
name
as
being
that
of
the
lawyer
to
whom
Mrs
had
written
the
night
before
John
rose
immediately
Show
him
into
my
study
Then
he
turned
to
us
My
mothers
lawyer
he
explained
And
in
a
lower
voice
He
is
also
understand
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
come
with
me
We
acquiesced
and
followed
him
out
of
the
room
John
strode
on
ahead
and
I
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering
to
There
will
be
an
inquest
then
nodded
He
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
so
much
so
that
my
curiosity
was
aroused
What
is
it
You
are
not
attending
to
what
I
say
It
is
true
my
friend
I
am
much
worried
Why
Because
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
does
not
take
sugar
in
her
coffee
What
You
cannot
be
serious
But
I
am
most
serious
Ah
there
is
something
there
that
I
do
not
understand
My
instinct
was
right
What
instinct
The
instinct
that
led
me
to
insist
on
examining
those
Chut
no
more
now
We
followed
John
into
his
study
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
us
Mr
Wells
was
a
pleasant
man
of
with
keen
eyes
and
the
typical
lawyers
mouth
John
introduced
us
both
and
explained
the
reason
of
our
presence
You
will
understand
Wells
he
added
that
this
is
all
strictly
private
We
are
still
hoping
that
there
will
turn
out
to
be
no
need
for
investigation
of
any
kind
Quite
so
quite
so
said
Mr
Wells
soothingly
I
wish
we
could
have
spared
you
the
pain
and
publicity
of
an
inquest
but
of
course
its
quite
unavoidable
in
the
absence
of
a
doctors
certificate
Yes
I
suppose
so
Clever
man
Great
authority
on
toxicology
I
believe
Indeed
said
John
with
a
certain
stiffness
in
his
manner
Then
he
added
rather
Shall
we
have
to
appear
as
of
us
I
mean
You
of
A
slight
pause
ensued
before
the
lawyer
went
on
in
his
soothing
manner
Any
other
evidence
will
be
simply
a
mere
matter
of
form
I
see
A
faint
expression
of
relief
swept
over
Johns
face
It
puzzled
me
for
I
saw
no
occasion
for
it
If
you
know
of
nothing
to
the
contrary
pursued
Mr
Wells
I
had
thought
of
Friday
That
will
give
us
plenty
of
time
for
the
doctors
report
The
postmortem
is
to
take
place
tonight
I
believe
Yes
Then
that
arrangement
will
suit
you
Perfectly
I
need
not
tell
you
my
dear
Cavendish
how
distressed
I
am
at
this
most
tragic
affair
Can
you
give
us
no
help
in
solving
it
monsieur
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
entered
the
room
I
Yes
we
heard
that
Mrs
wrote
to
you
last
night
You
should
have
received
the
letter
this
morning
I
did
but
it
contains
no
information
It
is
merely
a
note
asking
me
to
call
upon
her
this
morning
as
she
wanted
my
advice
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
She
gave
you
no
hint
as
to
what
that
matter
might
be
Unfortunately
no
That
is
a
pity
said
John
A
great
pity
agreed
gravely
There
was
silence
remained
lost
in
thought
for
a
few
minutes
Finally
he
turned
to
the
lawyer
Wells
there
is
one
thing
I
should
like
to
ask
is
if
it
is
not
against
professional
etiquette
In
the
event
of
Mrs
death
who
would
inherit
her
money
The
lawyer
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
replied
The
knowledge
will
be
public
property
very
soon
so
if
Mr
Cavendish
does
not
object
Not
at
all
John
I
do
not
see
any
reason
why
I
should
not
answer
your
question
By
her
last
will
dated
August
of
last
year
after
various
unimportant
legacies
to
servants
etc
she
gave
her
entire
fortune
to
her
stepson
Mr
John
Cavendish
Was
not
the
question
Mr
unfair
to
her
other
stepson
Mr
Lawrence
Cavendish
No
I
do
not
think
so
You
see
under
the
terms
of
their
fathers
will
while
John
inherited
the
property
Lawrence
at
his
stepmothers
death
would
come
into
a
considerable
sum
of
money
Mrs
left
her
money
to
her
elder
stepson
knowing
that
he
would
have
to
keep
up
Styles
It
was
to
my
mind
a
very
fair
and
equitable
distribution
nodded
thoughtfully
I
see
But
I
am
right
in
saying
am
I
not
that
by
your
English
law
that
will
was
automatically
revoked
when
Mrs
remarried
Mr
Wells
bowed
his
head
As
I
was
about
to
proceed
Monsieur
that
document
is
now
nan
and
void
said
He
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
Was
Mrs
herself
aware
of
that
fact
I
do
not
know
She
may
have
been
She
was
said
John
unexpectedly
We
were
discussing
the
matter
of
wills
being
revoked
by
marriage
only
yesterday
Ah
One
more
question
Mr
Wells
You
say
her
last
will
Had
Mrs
then
made
several
former
wills
On
an
average
she
made
a
new
will
at
least
once
a
year
said
Mr
Wells
She
was
given
to
changing
her
mind
as
to
her
dispositions
now
benefiting
one
now
another
member
of
her
family
Suppose
suggested
that
unknown
to
you
she
had
made
a
new
will
in
favour
of
some
one
who
was
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
member
of
the
will
say
Miss
for
you
be
surprised
Not
in
the
least
Ah
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
questions
I
drew
close
to
him
while
John
and
the
lawyer
were
debating
the
question
of
going
through
Mrs
papers
Do
you
think
Mrs
made
a
will
leaving
all
her
money
to
Miss
I
asked
in
a
low
voice
with
some
curiosity
smiled
No
Then
why
did
you
ask
Hush
John
Cavendish
had
turned
to
Will
you
come
with
us
Monsieur
We
are
going
through
my
mothers
papers
Mr
is
quite
willing
to
leave
it
entirely
to
Mr
Wells
and
myself
Which
simplifies
matters
very
much
murmured
the
lawyer
As
technically
of
course
he
was
entitled
He
did
not
finish
the
sentence
We
will
look
through
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
first
explained
John
and
go
up
to
her
bedroom
afterwards
She
kept
her
most
important
papers
in
a
purple
which
we
must
look
through
carefully
Yes
said
the
lawyer
it
is
quite
possible
that
there
may
be
a
later
will
than
the
one
in
my
possession
There
is
a
later
will
It
was
who
spoke
What
John
and
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
startled
Or
rather
pursued
my
friend
there
was
one
What
do
you
was
one
Where
is
it
now
Burnt
Burnt
Yes
See
here
He
took
out
the
charred
fragment
we
had
found
in
the
grate
in
Mrs
room
and
handed
it
to
the
lawyer
with
a
brief
explanation
of
when
and
where
he
had
found
it
But
possibly
this
is
an
old
will
I
do
not
think
so
In
fact
I
am
almost
certain
that
it
was
made
no
earlier
than
yesterday
afternoon
What
Impossible
broke
simultaneously
from
both
men
turned
to
John
If
you
will
allow
me
to
send
for
your
gardener
I
will
prove
it
to
you
Oh
of
I
dont
see
raised
his
hand
Do
as
I
ask
you
Afterwards
you
shall
question
as
much
as
you
please
Very
well
He
rang
the
bell
Dorcas
answered
it
in
due
course
Dorcas
will
you
tell
Manning
to
come
round
and
speak
to
me
here
Yes
sir
Dorcas
withdrew
We
waited
in
a
tense
silence
alone
seemed
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
dusted
a
forgotten
corner
of
the
bookcase
The
clumping
of
hobnailed
boots
on
the
gravel
outside
proclaimed
the
approach
of
Manning
John
looked
at
The
latter
nodded
Come
inside
Manning
said
John
I
want
to
speak
to
you
Manning
came
slowly
and
through
the
French
window
and
stood
as
near
it
as
he
could
He
held
his
cap
in
his
hands
twisting
it
very
carefully
round
and
round
His
back
was
much
bent
though
he
was
probably
not
as
old
as
he
looked
but
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
intelligent
and
belied
his
slow
and
rather
cautious
speech
Manning
said
John
this
gentleman
will
put
some
questions
to
you
which
I
want
you
to
answer
Yes
sir
mumbled
Manning
stepped
forward
briskly
eye
swept
over
him
with
a
faint
contempt
You
were
planting
a
bed
of
begonias
round
by
the
south
side
of
the
house
yesterday
afternoon
were
you
not
Manning
Yes
sir
me
and
And
Mrs
came
to
the
window
and
called
you
did
she
not
Yes
sir
she
did
Tell
me
in
your
own
words
exactly
what
happened
after
that
Well
sir
nothing
much
She
just
told
to
go
on
his
bicycle
down
to
the
village
and
bring
back
a
form
of
will
or
dont
know
what
wrote
it
down
for
him
Well
Well
he
did
sir
And
what
happened
next
We
went
on
with
the
begonias
sir
Did
not
Mrs
call
you
again
Yes
sir
both
me
and
she
called
And
then
She
made
us
come
right
in
and
sign
our
names
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
where
shed
signed
Did
you
see
anything
of
what
was
written
above
her
signature
asked
sharply
No
sir
there
was
a
bit
of
blotting
paper
over
that
part
And
you
signed
where
she
told
you
Yes
sir
first
me
and
then
What
did
she
do
with
it
afterwards
Well
sir
she
slipped
it
into
a
long
envelope
and
put
it
inside
a
sort
of
purple
box
that
was
standing
on
the
desk
What
time
was
it
when
she
first
called
you
About
four
I
should
say
sir
Not
earlier
Couldnt
it
have
been
about
three
No
I
shouldnt
say
so
sir
It
would
be
more
likely
to
be
a
bit
after
before
it
Thank
you
Manning
that
will
do
said
pleasantly
The
gardener
glanced
at
his
master
who
nodded
whereupon
Manning
lifted
a
finger
to
his
forehead
with
a
low
mumble
and
backed
cautiously
out
of
the
window
We
all
looked
at
each
other
Good
heavens
murmured
John
What
an
extraordinary
coincidence
coincidence
That
my
mother
should
have
made
a
will
on
the
very
day
of
her
death
Mr
Wells
cleared
his
throat
and
remarked
Are
you
so
sure
it
is
a
coincidence
Cavendish
What
do
you
mean
Your
mother
you
tell
me
had
a
violent
quarrel
one
yesterday
afternoon
What
do
you
mean
cried
John
again
There
was
a
tremor
in
his
voice
and
he
had
gone
very
pale
In
consequence
of
that
quarrel
your
mother
very
suddenly
and
hurriedly
makes
a
new
will
The
contents
of
that
will
we
shall
never
know
She
told
no
one
of
its
provisions
This
morning
no
doubt
she
would
have
consulted
me
on
the
she
had
no
chance
The
will
disappears
and
she
takes
its
secret
with
her
to
her
grave
Cavendish
I
much
fear
there
is
no
coincidence
there
Monsieur
I
am
sure
you
agree
with
me
that
the
facts
are
very
suggestive
Suggestive
or
not
interrupted
John
we
are
most
grateful
to
Monsieur
for
the
matter
But
for
him
we
should
never
have
known
of
this
will
I
suppose
I
may
not
ask
you
monsieur
what
first
led
you
to
suspect
the
fact
smiled
and
answered
A
scribbled
over
old
envelope
and
a
freshly
planted
bed
of
begonias
John
I
think
would
have
pressed
his
questions
further
but
at
that
moment
the
loud
purr
of
a
motor
was
audible
and
we
all
turned
to
the
window
as
it
swept
past
cried
John
Excuse
me
Wells
He
went
hurriedly
out
into
the
hall
looked
at
me
Miss
I
explained
Ah
I
am
glad
she
has
come
There
is
a
woman
with
a
head
and
a
heart
too
Hastings
Though
the
good
God
gave
her
no
beauty
I
followed
Johns
example
and
went
out
into
the
hall
where
Miss
was
endeavouring
to
extricate
herself
from
the
voluminous
mass
of
veils
that
enveloped
her
head
As
her
eyes
fell
on
me
a
sudden
pang
of
guilt
shot
through
me
This
was
the
woman
who
had
warned
me
so
earnestly
and
to
whose
warning
I
had
alas
paid
no
heed
How
soon
and
how
contemptuously
I
had
dismissed
it
from
my
mind
Now
that
she
had
been
proved
justified
in
so
tragic
a
manner
I
felt
ashamed
She
had
known
Alfred
only
too
well
I
wondered
whether
if
she
had
remained
at
Styles
the
tragedy
would
have
taken
place
or
would
the
man
have
feared
her
watchful
eyes
I
was
relieved
when
she
shook
me
by
the
hand
with
her
well
remembered
painful
grip
The
eyes
that
met
mine
were
sad
but
not
reproachful
that
she
had
been
crying
bitterly
I
could
tell
by
the
redness
of
her
eyelids
but
her
manner
was
unchanged
from
its
old
Started
the
moment
I
got
the
wire
Just
come
off
night
duty
Hired
car
Quickest
way
to
get
here
Have
you
had
anything
to
eat
this
morning
asked
John
No
I
thought
not
Come
along
breakfasts
not
cleared
away
yet
and
theyll
make
you
some
fresh
tea
He
turned
to
me
Look
after
her
Hastings
will
you
Wells
is
waiting
for
me
Oh
heres
Monsieur
Hes
helping
us
you
know
Miss
shook
hands
with
but
glanced
suspiciously
over
her
shoulder
at
John
What
do
you
us
Helping
us
to
investigate
Nothing
to
investigate
Have
they
taken
him
to
prison
yet
Taken
who
to
prison
Who
Alfred
of
course
My
dear
do
be
careful
Lawrence
is
of
the
opinion
that
my
mother
died
from
heart
seizure
More
fool
Lawrence
retorted
Miss
Of
course
Alfred
murdered
poor
I
always
told
you
he
would
My
dear
dont
shout
so
Whatever
we
may
think
or
suspect
it
is
better
to
say
as
little
as
possible
for
the
present
The
inquest
isnt
until
Friday
Not
until
fiddlesticks
The
snort
Miss
gave
was
truly
magnificent
Youre
all
off
your
heads
The
man
will
be
out
of
the
country
by
then
If
hes
any
sense
he
wont
stay
here
tamely
and
wait
to
be
hanged
John
Cavendish
looked
at
her
helplessly
I
know
what
it
is
she
accused
him
youve
been
listening
to
the
doctors
Never
should
What
do
they
know
Nothing
at
just
enough
to
make
them
dangerous
I
ought
to
own
father
was
a
doctor
That
little
is
about
the
greatest
fool
that
even
I
have
ever
seen
Heart
seizure
Sort
of
thing
he
would
say
Anyone
with
any
sense
could
see
at
once
that
her
husband
had
poisoned
her
I
always
said
hed
murder
her
in
her
bed
poor
soul
Now
hes
done
it
And
all
you
can
do
is
to
murmur
silly
things
about
heart
seizure
and
inquest
on
Friday
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
John
Cavendish
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
John
unable
to
help
a
faint
smile
Dash
it
all
I
cant
haul
him
down
to
the
local
police
station
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
Well
you
might
do
something
Find
out
how
he
did
it
Hes
a
crafty
beggar
Dare
say
he
soaked
fly
papers
Ask
Cook
if
shes
missed
any
It
occurred
to
me
very
forcibly
at
that
moment
that
to
harbour
Miss
and
Alfred
under
the
same
roof
and
keep
the
peace
between
them
was
likely
to
prove
a
Herculean
task
and
I
did
not
envy
John
I
could
see
by
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
fully
appreciated
the
difficulty
of
the
position
For
the
moment
he
sought
refuge
in
retreat
and
left
the
room
Dorcas
brought
in
fresh
tea
As
she
left
the
room
came
over
from
the
window
where
he
had
been
standing
and
sat
down
facing
Miss
Mademoiselle
he
said
gravely
I
want
to
ask
you
something
Ask
away
said
the
lady
eyeing
him
with
some
disfavour
I
want
to
be
able
to
count
upon
your
help
Ill
help
you
to
hang
Alfred
with
pleasure
she
replied
Hangings
too
good
for
him
Ought
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
like
in
good
old
times
We
are
at
one
then
said
for
I
too
want
to
hang
the
criminal
Alfred
Him
or
another
No
question
of
another
Poor
Emily
was
never
murdered
until
he
came
along
I
dont
say
she
wasnt
surrounded
by
was
But
it
was
only
her
purse
they
were
after
Her
life
was
safe
enough
But
along
comes
Mr
Alfred
within
two
presto
Believe
me
Miss
said
very
earnestly
if
Mr
is
the
man
he
shall
not
escape
me
On
my
honour
I
will
hang
him
as
high
as
Haman
Thats
better
said
Miss
more
enthusiastically
But
I
must
ask
you
to
trust
me
Now
your
help
may
be
very
valuable
to
me
I
will
tell
you
why
Because
in
all
this
house
of
mourning
yours
are
the
only
eyes
that
have
wept
Miss
blinked
and
a
new
note
crept
into
the
of
her
voice
If
you
mean
that
I
was
fond
of
I
was
You
know
Emily
was
a
selfish
old
woman
in
her
way
She
was
very
generous
but
she
always
wanted
a
return
She
never
let
people
forget
what
she
had
done
for
that
way
she
missed
love
Dont
think
she
ever
realized
it
though
or
felt
the
lack
of
it
Hope
not
anyway
I
was
on
a
different
footing
I
took
my
stand
from
the
first
So
many
pounds
a
year
Im
worth
to
you
Well
and
good
But
not
a
penny
piece
a
pair
of
gloves
nor
a
theatre
ticket
She
didnt
very
offended
sometimes
Said
I
was
foolishly
proud
It
wasnt
I
couldnt
explain
Anyway
I
kept
my
And
so
out
of
the
whole
bunch
I
was
the
only
one
who
could
allow
myself
to
be
fond
of
her
I
watched
over
her
I
guarded
her
from
the
lot
of
them
and
then
a
scoundrel
comes
along
and
pooh
all
my
years
of
devotion
go
for
nothing
nodded
sympathetically
I
understand
mademoiselle
I
understand
all
you
feel
It
is
most
natural
You
think
that
we
are
we
lack
fire
and
trust
me
it
is
not
so
John
stuck
his
head
in
at
this
juncture
and
invited
us
both
to
come
up
to
Mrs
room
as
he
and
Mr
Wells
had
finished
looking
through
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
As
we
went
up
the
stairs
John
looked
back
to
the
door
and
lowered
his
voice
confidentially
Look
here
whats
going
to
happen
when
these
two
meet
I
shook
my
head
helplessly
Ive
told
Mary
to
keep
them
apart
if
she
can
Will
she
be
able
to
do
so
The
Lord
only
knows
Theres
one
thing
himself
wont
be
too
keen
on
meeting
her
Youve
got
the
keys
still
havent
you
I
asked
as
we
reached
the
door
of
the
locked
room
Taking
the
keys
from
John
unlocked
it
and
we
all
passed
in
The
lawyer
went
straight
to
the
desk
and
John
followed
him
My
mother
kept
most
of
her
important
papers
in
this
I
believe
he
said
drew
out
the
small
bunch
of
keys
Permit
me
I
locked
it
out
of
precaution
this
morning
But
its
not
locked
now
Impossible
See
And
John
lifted
the
lid
as
he
spoke
Milles
cried
dumfounded
And
have
both
the
keys
in
my
pocket
He
flung
himself
upon
the
case
Suddenly
he
stiffened
En
voila
affaire
This
lock
has
been
forced
What
laid
down
the
case
again
But
who
forced
it
Why
should
they
When
But
the
door
was
locked
These
burst
from
us
answered
them
mechanically
Who
That
is
the
question
Why
Ah
if
I
only
knew
When
Since
I
was
here
an
hour
ago
As
to
the
door
being
locked
it
is
a
very
ordinary
lock
Probably
any
other
of
the
in
this
passage
would
fit
it
We
stared
at
one
another
blankly
had
walked
over
to
the
mantelpiece
He
was
outwardly
calm
but
I
noticed
his
hands
which
from
long
force
of
habit
were
mechanically
straightening
the
spill
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
were
shaking
violently
See
here
it
was
like
this
he
said
at
last
There
was
something
in
that
piece
of
evidence
slight
in
itself
perhaps
but
still
enough
of
a
clue
to
connect
the
murderer
with
the
crime
It
was
vital
to
him
that
it
should
be
destroyed
before
it
was
discovered
and
its
significance
appreciated
Therefore
he
took
the
risk
the
great
risk
of
coming
in
here
Finding
the
case
locked
he
was
obliged
to
force
it
thus
betraying
his
presence
For
him
to
take
that
risk
it
must
have
been
something
of
great
importance
But
what
was
it
Ah
cried
with
a
gesture
of
anger
That
I
do
not
know
A
document
of
some
kind
without
doubt
possibly
the
scrap
of
paper
Dorcas
saw
in
her
hand
yesterday
afternoon
And
I
his
anger
burst
forth
animal
that
I
am
I
guessed
nothing
I
have
behaved
like
an
imbecile
I
should
never
have
left
that
case
here
I
should
have
carried
it
away
with
me
Ah
triple
pig
And
now
it
is
gone
It
is
is
it
destroyed
Is
there
not
yet
a
must
leave
no
stone
unturned
He
rushed
like
a
madman
from
the
room
and
I
followed
him
as
soon
as
I
had
sufficiently
recovered
my
wits
But
by
the
time
I
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
was
out
of
sight
Mary
Cavendish
was
standing
where
the
staircase
branched
staring
down
into
the
hall
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
disappeared
What
has
happened
to
your
extraordinary
little
friend
Mr
Hastings
He
has
just
rushed
past
me
like
a
mad
bull
Hes
rather
upset
about
something
I
remarked
feebly
I
really
did
not
know
how
much
would
wish
me
to
disclose
As
I
saw
a
faint
smile
gather
on
Mrs
expressive
mouth
I
endeavoured
to
try
and
turn
the
conversation
by
saying
They
havent
met
yet
have
they
Who
Mr
and
Miss
She
looked
at
me
in
rather
a
disconcerting
manner
Do
you
think
it
would
be
such
a
disaster
if
they
did
meet
Well
dont
you
I
said
rather
taken
aback
No
She
was
smiling
in
her
quiet
way
I
should
like
to
see
a
good
flare
up
It
would
clear
the
air
At
present
we
are
all
thinking
so
much
and
saying
so
little
John
doesnt
think
so
I
remarked
Hes
anxious
to
keep
them
apart
Oh
John
Something
in
her
tone
fired
me
and
I
blurted
out
Old
Johns
an
awfully
good
sort
She
studied
me
curiously
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
to
my
great
surprise
You
are
loyal
to
your
friend
I
like
you
for
that
Arent
you
my
friend
too
I
am
a
very
bad
friend
Why
do
you
say
that
Because
it
is
true
I
am
charming
to
my
friends
one
day
and
forget
all
about
them
the
next
I
dont
know
what
impelled
me
but
I
was
and
I
said
foolishly
and
not
in
the
best
of
taste
Yet
you
seem
to
be
invariably
charming
to
Dr
Instantly
I
regretted
my
words
Her
face
stiffened
I
had
the
impression
of
a
steel
curtain
coming
down
and
blotting
out
the
real
woman
Without
a
word
she
turned
and
went
swiftly
up
the
stairs
whilst
I
stood
like
an
idiot
gaping
after
her
I
was
recalled
to
other
matters
by
a
frightful
row
going
on
below
I
could
hear
shouting
and
expounding
I
was
vexed
to
think
that
my
diplomacy
had
been
in
vain
The
little
man
appeared
to
be
taking
the
whole
house
into
his
confidence
a
proceeding
of
which
I
for
one
doubted
the
wisdom
Once
again
I
could
not
help
regretting
that
my
friend
was
so
prone
to
lose
his
head
in
moments
of
excitement
I
stepped
briskly
down
the
stairs
The
sight
of
me
calmed
almost
immediately
I
drew
him
aside
My
dear
fellow
I
said
is
this
wise
Surely
you
dont
want
the
whole
house
to
know
of
this
occurrence
You
are
actually
playing
into
the
criminals
hands
You
think
so
Hastings
I
am
sure
of
it
Well
well
my
friend
I
will
be
guided
by
you
Good
Although
unfortunately
it
is
a
little
too
late
now
Sure
He
looked
so
crestfallen
and
that
I
felt
quite
sorry
though
I
still
thought
my
rebuke
a
just
and
wise
one
Well
he
said
at
last
let
us
go
mon
ami
You
have
finished
here
For
the
moment
yes
You
will
walk
back
with
me
to
the
village
Willingly
He
picked
up
his
little
suitcase
and
we
went
out
through
the
open
window
in
the
Cynthia
was
just
coming
in
and
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
Excuse
me
mademoiselle
one
minute
Yes
she
turned
Did
you
ever
make
up
Mrs
medicines
A
slight
flush
rose
in
her
face
as
she
answered
rather
No
Only
her
powders
The
flush
deepened
as
Cynthia
replied
Oh
yes
I
did
make
up
some
sleeping
powders
for
her
once
These
produced
the
empty
box
which
had
contained
powders
She
nodded
Can
you
tell
me
what
they
were
Veronal
No
they
were
bromide
powders
Ah
Thank
you
mademoiselle
good
morning
As
we
walked
briskly
away
from
the
house
I
glanced
at
him
more
than
once
I
had
often
before
noticed
that
if
anything
excited
him
his
eyes
turned
green
like
a
cats
They
were
shining
like
emeralds
now
My
friend
he
broke
out
at
last
I
have
a
little
idea
a
very
strange
and
probably
utterly
impossible
idea
And
fits
in
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
I
privately
thought
that
was
rather
too
much
given
to
these
fantastic
ideas
In
this
case
surely
the
truth
was
only
too
plain
and
apparent
So
that
is
the
explanation
of
the
blank
label
on
the
box
I
remarked
Very
simple
as
you
said
I
really
wonder
that
I
did
not
think
of
it
myself
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
to
me
They
have
made
one
more
discovery
he
observed
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
Styles
Mr
Wells
told
me
as
we
were
going
upstairs
What
was
it
Locked
up
in
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
they
found
a
will
of
Mrs
dated
before
her
marriage
leaving
her
fortune
to
Alfred
It
must
have
been
made
just
at
the
time
they
were
engaged
It
came
quite
as
a
surprise
to
to
John
Cavendish
also
It
was
written
on
one
of
those
printed
will
forms
and
witnessed
by
two
of
the
Dorcas
Did
Mr
know
of
it
He
says
not
One
might
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
I
remarked
sceptically
All
these
wills
are
very
confusing
Tell
me
how
did
those
scribbled
words
on
the
envelope
help
you
to
discover
that
a
will
was
made
yesterday
afternoon
smiled
Mon
ami
have
you
ever
when
writing
a
letter
been
arrested
by
the
fact
that
you
did
not
know
how
to
spell
a
certain
word
Yes
often
I
suppose
every
one
has
Exactly
And
have
you
not
in
such
a
case
tried
the
word
once
or
twice
on
the
edge
of
the
or
a
spare
scrap
of
paper
to
see
if
it
looked
right
Well
that
is
what
Mrs
did
You
will
notice
that
the
word
possessed
is
spelt
first
with
one
s
and
subsequently
with
To
make
sure
she
had
further
tried
it
in
a
sentence
thus
I
am
possessed
Now
what
did
that
tell
me
It
told
me
that
Mrs
had
been
writing
the
word
possessed
that
afternoon
and
having
the
fragment
of
paper
found
in
the
grate
fresh
in
my
mind
the
possibility
of
a
document
almost
certain
to
contain
that
to
me
at
once
This
possibility
was
confirmed
by
a
further
circumstance
In
the
general
confusion
the
boudoir
had
not
been
swept
that
morning
and
near
the
desk
were
several
traces
of
brown
mould
and
earth
The
weather
had
been
perfectly
fine
for
some
days
and
no
ordinary
boots
would
have
left
such
a
heavy
deposit
I
strolled
to
the
window
and
saw
at
once
that
the
begonia
beds
had
been
newly
planted
The
mould
in
the
beds
was
exactly
similar
to
that
on
the
floor
of
the
boudoir
and
also
I
learnt
from
you
that
they
had
been
planted
yesterday
afternoon
I
was
now
sure
that
one
or
possibly
both
of
the
there
were
two
sets
of
footprints
in
the
entered
the
boudoir
for
if
Mrs
had
merely
wished
to
speak
to
them
she
would
in
all
probability
have
stood
at
the
window
and
they
would
not
have
come
into
the
room
at
all
I
was
now
quite
convinced
that
she
had
made
a
fresh
will
and
had
called
the
two
gardeners
in
to
witness
her
signature
Events
proved
that
I
was
right
in
my
supposition
That
was
very
ingenious
I
could
not
help
admitting
I
must
confess
that
the
conclusions
I
drew
from
those
few
scribbled
words
were
quite
erroneous
He
smiled
You
gave
too
much
rein
to
your
imagination
Imagination
is
a
good
servant
and
a
bad
master
The
simplest
explanation
is
always
the
most
likely
Another
did
you
know
that
the
key
of
the
had
been
lost
I
did
not
know
it
It
was
a
guess
that
turned
out
to
be
correct
You
observed
that
it
had
a
piece
of
twisted
wire
through
the
handle
That
suggested
to
me
at
once
that
it
had
possibly
been
wrenched
off
a
flimsy
Now
if
it
had
been
lost
and
recovered
Mrs
would
at
once
have
replaced
it
on
her
bunch
but
on
her
bunch
I
found
what
was
obviously
the
duplicate
key
very
new
and
bright
which
led
me
to
the
hypothesis
that
somebody
else
had
inserted
the
original
key
in
the
lock
of
the
Yes
I
said
Alfred
without
doubt
looked
at
me
curiously
You
are
very
sure
of
his
guilt
Well
naturally
Every
fresh
circumstance
seems
to
establish
it
more
clearly
On
the
contrary
said
quietly
there
are
several
points
in
his
favour
Oh
come
now
Yes
I
see
only
one
And
that
That
he
was
not
in
the
house
last
night
Bad
shot
as
you
English
say
You
have
chosen
the
one
point
that
to
my
mind
tells
against
him
How
is
that
Because
if
Mr
knew
that
his
wife
would
be
poisoned
last
night
he
would
certainly
have
arranged
to
be
away
from
the
house
His
excuse
was
an
obviously
trumped
up
one
That
leaves
us
two
possibilities
either
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
or
he
had
a
reason
of
his
own
for
his
absence
And
that
reason
I
asked
sceptically
shrugged
his
shoulders
How
should
I
know
Discreditable
without
doubt
This
Mr
I
should
say
is
somewhat
of
a
that
does
not
of
necessity
make
him
a
murderer
I
shook
my
head
unconvinced
We
do
not
agree
eh
said
Well
let
us
leave
it
Time
will
show
which
of
us
is
right
Now
let
us
turn
to
other
aspects
of
the
case
What
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
all
the
doors
of
the
bedroom
were
bolted
on
the
inside
Well
I
considered
One
must
look
at
it
logically
True
I
should
put
it
this
way
The
doors
were
own
eyes
have
told
us
the
presence
of
the
candle
grease
on
the
floor
and
the
destruction
of
the
will
prove
that
during
the
night
some
one
entered
the
room
You
agree
so
far
Perfectly
Put
with
admirable
clearness
Proceed
Well
I
said
encouraged
as
the
person
who
entered
did
not
do
so
by
the
window
nor
by
miraculous
means
it
follows
that
the
door
must
have
been
opened
from
inside
by
Mrs
herself
That
strengthens
the
conviction
that
the
person
in
question
was
her
husband
She
would
naturally
open
the
door
to
her
own
husband
shook
his
head
Why
should
she
She
had
bolted
the
door
leading
into
his
most
unusual
proceeding
on
her
had
had
a
most
violent
quarrel
with
him
that
very
afternoon
No
he
was
the
last
person
she
would
admit
But
you
agree
with
me
that
the
door
must
have
been
opened
by
Mrs
herself
There
is
another
possibility
She
may
have
forgotten
to
bolt
the
door
into
the
passage
when
she
went
to
bed
and
have
got
up
later
towards
morning
and
bolted
it
then
is
that
seriously
your
opinion
No
I
do
not
say
it
is
so
but
it
might
be
Now
to
turn
to
another
feature
what
do
you
make
of
the
scrap
of
conversation
you
overheard
between
Mrs
Cavendish
and
her
I
had
forgotten
that
I
said
thoughtfully
That
is
as
enigmatical
as
ever
It
seems
incredible
that
a
woman
like
Mrs
Cavendish
proud
and
reticent
to
the
last
degree
should
interfere
so
violently
in
what
was
certainly
not
her
affair
Precisely
It
was
an
astonishing
thing
for
a
woman
of
her
breeding
to
do
It
is
certainly
curious
I
agreed
Still
it
is
unimportant
and
need
not
be
taken
into
account
A
groan
burst
from
What
have
I
always
told
you
Everything
must
be
taken
into
account
If
the
fact
will
not
fit
the
the
theory
go
Well
we
shall
see
I
said
Yes
we
shall
see
We
had
reached
Leastways
Cottage
and
ushered
me
upstairs
to
his
own
room
He
offered
me
one
of
the
tiny
Russian
cigarettes
he
himself
occasionally
smoked
I
was
amused
to
notice
that
he
stowed
away
the
used
matches
most
carefully
in
a
little
china
pot
My
momentary
annoyance
vanished
had
placed
our
two
chairs
in
front
of
the
open
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
village
street
The
fresh
air
blew
in
warm
and
pleasant
It
was
going
to
be
a
hot
day
Suddenly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
weedy
looking
young
man
rushing
down
the
street
at
a
great
pace
It
was
the
expression
on
his
face
that
was
curious
mingling
of
terror
and
agitation
Look
I
said
He
leant
forward
Tiens
he
said
It
is
Mr
Mace
from
the
chemists
shop
He
is
coming
here
The
young
man
came
to
a
halt
before
Leastways
Cottage
and
after
hesitating
a
moment
pounded
vigorously
at
the
door
A
little
minute
cried
from
the
window
I
come
Motioning
to
me
to
follow
him
he
ran
swiftly
down
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
Mr
Mace
began
at
Mr
Im
sorry
for
the
inconvenience
but
I
heard
that
youd
just
come
back
from
the
Hall
Yes
we
have
The
young
man
moistened
his
dry
lips
His
face
was
working
curiously
Its
all
over
the
village
about
old
Mrs
dying
so
suddenly
They
do
say
he
lowered
his
voice
its
poison
face
remained
quite
impassive
Only
the
doctors
can
tell
us
that
Mr
Mace
Yes
course
The
young
man
hesitated
and
then
his
agitation
was
too
much
for
him
He
clutched
by
the
arm
and
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
Just
tell
me
this
Mr
it
isnt
strychnine
is
it
I
hardly
heard
what
replied
Something
evidently
of
a
noncommittal
nature
The
young
man
departed
and
as
he
closed
the
door
eyes
met
mine
Yes
he
said
nodding
gravely
He
will
have
evidence
to
give
at
the
inquest
We
went
slowly
upstairs
again
I
was
opening
my
lips
when
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
Not
now
not
now
mon
ami
I
have
need
of
reflection
My
mind
is
in
some
is
not
well
For
about
ten
minutes
he
sat
in
dead
silence
perfectly
still
except
for
several
expressive
motions
of
his
eyebrows
and
all
the
time
his
eyes
grew
steadily
greener
At
last
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
It
is
well
The
bad
moment
has
passed
Now
all
is
arranged
and
classified
One
must
never
permit
confusion
The
case
is
not
clear
For
it
is
of
the
most
complicated
It
puzzles
me
Me
There
are
two
facts
of
significance
And
what
are
they
The
first
is
the
state
of
the
weather
yesterday
That
is
very
important
But
it
was
a
glorious
day
I
interrupted
youre
pulling
my
leg
Not
at
all
The
thermometer
registered
degrees
in
the
shade
Do
not
forget
that
my
friend
It
is
the
key
to
the
whole
riddle
And
the
second
point
I
asked
The
important
fact
that
Monsieur
wears
very
peculiar
clothes
has
a
black
beard
and
uses
glasses
I
cannot
believe
you
are
serious
I
am
absolutely
serious
my
friend
But
this
is
childish
No
it
is
very
momentous
And
supposing
the
Coroners
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
Wilful
Murder
against
Alfred
What
becomes
of
your
theories
then
They
would
not
be
shaken
because
twelve
stupid
men
had
happened
to
make
a
mistake
But
that
will
not
occur
For
one
thing
a
country
jury
is
not
anxious
to
take
responsibility
upon
itself
and
Mr
stands
practically
in
the
position
of
local
squire
Also
he
added
I
should
not
allow
it
You
would
not
allow
it
No
I
looked
at
the
extraordinary
little
man
divided
between
annoyance
and
amusement
He
was
so
tremendously
sure
of
himself
As
though
he
read
my
thoughts
he
nodded
gently
Oh
yes
mon
ami
I
would
do
what
I
say
He
got
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
His
physiognomy
underwent
a
complete
change
Tears
came
into
his
eyes
In
all
this
you
see
I
think
of
that
poor
Mrs
who
is
dead
She
was
not
extravagantly
But
she
was
very
good
to
us
owe
her
a
debt
I
endeavoured
to
interrupt
but
swept
on
Let
me
tell
you
this
Hastings
She
would
never
forgive
me
if
I
let
Alfred
her
husband
be
arrested
a
word
from
me
could
save
him
In
the
interval
before
the
inquest
was
unfailing
in
his
activity
Twice
he
was
closeted
with
Mr
Wells
He
also
took
long
walks
into
the
country
I
rather
resented
his
not
taking
me
into
his
confidence
the
more
so
as
I
could
not
in
the
least
guess
what
he
was
driving
at
It
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
making
inquiries
at
farm
so
finding
him
out
when
I
called
at
Leastways
Cottage
on
Wednesday
evening
I
walked
over
there
by
the
fields
hoping
to
meet
him
But
there
was
no
sign
of
him
and
I
hesitated
to
go
right
up
to
the
farm
itself
As
I
walked
away
I
met
an
aged
rustic
who
leered
at
me
cunningly
from
the
Hall
you
he
asked
Yes
Im
looking
for
a
friend
of
mine
whom
I
thought
might
have
walked
this
way
A
little
chap
As
waves
his
hands
when
he
talks
One
of
them
from
the
village
Yes
I
said
eagerly
He
has
been
here
then
Oh
ay
hes
been
here
right
enough
once
of
yours
is
he
Ah
you
gentlemen
from
the
a
pretty
lot
And
he
leered
more
than
ever
Why
do
the
gentlemen
from
the
Hall
come
here
often
I
asked
as
carelessly
as
I
could
He
winked
at
me
knowingly
One
does
mister
Naming
no
names
mind
And
a
very
liberal
gentleman
too
Oh
thank
you
sir
Im
sure
I
walked
on
sharply
had
been
right
then
and
I
experienced
a
sharp
twinge
of
disgust
as
I
thought
of
Alfred
with
another
womans
money
Had
that
piquant
gipsy
face
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
crime
or
was
it
the
baser
mainspring
of
money
Probably
a
judicious
mixture
of
both
On
one
point
seemed
to
have
a
curious
obsession
He
once
or
twice
observed
to
me
that
he
thought
Dorcas
must
have
made
an
error
in
fixing
the
time
of
the
quarrel
He
suggested
to
her
repeatedly
that
it
was
and
not
oclock
when
she
had
heard
the
voices
But
Dorcas
was
unshaken
Quite
an
hour
or
even
more
had
elapsed
between
the
time
when
she
had
heard
the
voices
and
oclock
when
she
had
taken
tea
to
her
mistress
The
inquest
was
held
on
Friday
at
the
Arms
in
the
village
and
I
sat
together
not
being
required
to
give
evidence
The
preliminaries
were
gone
through
The
jury
viewed
the
body
and
John
Cavendish
gave
evidence
of
identification
Further
questioned
he
described
his
awakening
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
and
the
circumstances
of
his
mothers
death
The
medical
evidence
was
next
taken
There
was
a
breathless
hush
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
famous
London
specialist
who
was
known
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
authorities
of
the
day
on
the
subject
of
toxicology
In
a
few
brief
words
he
summed
up
the
result
of
the
postmortem
Shorn
of
its
medical
phraseology
and
technicalities
it
amounted
to
the
fact
that
Mrs
had
met
her
death
as
the
result
of
strychnine
poisoning
Judging
from
the
quantity
recovered
she
must
have
taken
not
less
than
of
a
grain
of
strychnine
but
probably
one
grain
or
slightly
over
Is
it
possible
that
she
could
have
swallowed
the
poison
by
accident
asked
the
Coroner
I
should
consider
it
very
unlikely
Strychnine
is
not
used
for
domestic
purposes
as
some
poisons
are
and
there
are
restrictions
placed
on
its
sale
Does
anything
in
your
examination
lead
you
to
determine
how
the
poison
was
administered
No
You
arrived
at
Styles
before
Dr
I
believe
That
is
so
The
motor
met
me
just
outside
the
lodge
gates
and
I
hurried
there
as
fast
as
I
could
Will
you
relate
to
us
exactly
what
happened
next
I
entered
Mrs
room
She
was
at
that
moment
in
a
typical
convulsion
She
turned
towards
me
and
gasped
out
Could
the
strychnine
have
been
administered
in
Mrs
coffee
which
was
taken
to
her
by
her
husband
Possibly
but
strychnine
is
a
fairly
rapid
drug
in
its
action
The
symptoms
appear
from
one
to
two
hours
after
it
has
been
swallowed
It
is
retarded
under
certain
conditions
nan
of
which
however
appear
to
have
been
present
in
this
case
I
presume
Mrs
took
the
coffee
after
dinner
about
eight
oclock
whereas
the
symptoms
did
not
manifest
themselves
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
which
on
the
face
of
it
points
to
the
drug
having
been
taken
much
later
in
the
evening
Mrs
was
in
the
habit
of
drinking
a
cup
of
cocoa
in
the
middle
of
the
night
Could
the
strychnine
have
been
administered
in
that
No
I
myself
took
a
sample
of
the
cocoa
remaining
in
the
saucepan
and
had
it
analysed
There
was
no
strychnine
present
I
heard
chuckle
softly
beside
me
How
did
you
know
I
whispered
Listen
I
should
doctor
was
I
would
have
been
considerably
surprised
at
any
other
result
Why
Simply
because
strychnine
has
an
unusually
bitter
taste
It
can
be
detected
in
a
solution
of
in
and
can
only
be
disguised
by
some
strongly
flavoured
substance
cocoa
would
be
quite
powerless
to
mask
it
One
of
the
jury
wanted
to
know
if
the
same
objection
applied
to
coffee
No
Coffee
has
a
bitter
taste
of
its
own
which
would
probably
cover
the
taste
of
strychnine
Then
you
consider
it
more
likely
that
the
drug
was
administered
in
the
coffee
but
that
for
some
unknown
reason
its
action
was
delayed
Yes
but
the
cup
being
completely
smashed
there
is
no
possibility
of
analyzing
its
contents
This
concluded
Dr
evidence
Dr
corroborated
it
on
all
points
Sounded
as
to
the
possibility
of
suicide
he
it
utterly
The
deceased
he
said
suffered
from
a
weak
heart
but
otherwise
enjoyed
perfect
health
and
was
of
a
cheerful
and
disposition
She
would
be
one
of
the
last
people
to
take
her
own
life
Lawrence
Cavendish
was
next
called
His
evidence
was
quite
unimportant
being
a
mere
repetition
of
that
of
his
brother
Just
as
he
was
about
to
step
down
he
paused
and
said
rather
I
should
like
to
make
a
suggestion
if
I
may
He
glanced
at
the
Coroner
who
replied
briskly
Certainly
Mr
Cavendish
we
are
here
to
arrive
at
the
truth
of
this
matter
and
welcome
anything
that
may
lead
to
further
elucidation
It
is
just
an
idea
of
mine
explained
Lawrence
Of
course
I
may
be
quite
wrong
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
my
mothers
death
might
be
accounted
for
by
natural
means
How
do
you
make
that
out
Mr
Cavendish
My
mother
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
for
some
time
before
it
was
taking
a
tonic
containing
strychnine
Ah
said
the
Coroner
The
jury
looked
up
interested
I
believe
continued
Lawrence
that
there
have
been
cases
where
the
cumulative
effect
of
a
drug
administered
for
some
time
has
ended
by
causing
death
Also
is
it
not
possible
that
she
may
have
taken
an
overdose
of
her
medicine
by
accident
This
is
the
first
we
have
heard
of
the
deceased
taking
strychnine
at
the
time
of
her
death
We
are
much
obliged
to
you
Mr
Cavendish
Dr
was
recalled
and
ridiculed
the
idea
What
Mr
Cavendish
suggests
is
quite
impossible
Any
doctor
would
tell
you
the
same
Strychnine
is
in
a
certain
sense
a
cumulative
poison
but
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
it
to
result
in
sudden
death
in
this
way
There
would
have
to
be
a
long
period
of
chronic
symptoms
which
would
at
once
have
attracted
my
attention
The
whole
thing
is
absurd
And
the
second
suggestion
That
Mrs
may
have
inadvertently
taken
an
overdose
Three
or
even
four
doses
would
not
have
resulted
in
death
Mrs
always
had
an
extra
large
amount
of
medicine
made
up
at
a
time
as
she
dealt
with
Coots
the
Cash
Chemists
in
She
would
have
had
to
take
very
nearly
the
whole
bottle
to
account
for
the
amount
of
strychnine
found
at
the
postmortem
Then
you
consider
that
we
may
dismiss
the
tonic
as
not
being
in
any
way
instrumental
in
causing
her
death
Certainly
The
supposition
is
ridiculous
The
same
who
had
interrupted
before
here
suggested
that
the
chemist
who
made
up
the
medicine
might
have
committed
an
error
That
of
course
is
always
possible
replied
the
doctor
But
Dorcas
who
was
the
next
witness
called
dispelled
even
that
possibility
The
medicine
had
not
been
newly
made
up
On
the
contrary
Mrs
had
taken
the
last
dose
on
the
day
of
her
death
So
the
question
of
the
tonic
was
finally
abandoned
and
the
Coroner
proceeded
with
his
task
Having
elicited
from
Dorcas
how
she
had
been
awakened
by
the
violent
ringing
of
her
bell
and
had
subsequently
roused
the
household
he
passed
to
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
on
the
preceding
afternoon
evidence
on
this
point
was
substantially
what
and
I
had
already
heard
so
I
will
not
repeat
it
here
The
next
witness
was
Mary
Cavendish
She
stood
very
upright
and
spoke
in
a
low
clear
and
perfectly
composed
voice
In
answer
to
the
Coroners
question
she
told
how
her
alarm
clock
having
aroused
her
at
as
usual
she
was
dressing
when
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
something
heavy
falling
That
would
have
been
the
table
by
the
bed
commented
the
Coroner
I
opened
my
door
continued
Mary
and
listened
In
a
few
minutes
a
bell
rang
violently
Dorcas
came
running
down
and
woke
my
husband
and
we
all
went
to
my
room
but
it
was
locked
The
Coroner
interrupted
her
I
really
do
not
think
we
need
trouble
you
further
on
that
point
We
know
all
that
can
be
known
of
the
subsequent
happenings
But
I
should
be
obliged
if
you
would
tell
us
all
you
overheard
of
the
quarrel
the
day
before
I
There
was
a
faint
insolence
in
her
voice
She
raised
her
hand
and
adjusted
the
ruffle
of
lace
at
her
neck
turning
her
head
a
little
as
she
did
so
And
quite
spontaneously
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
She
is
gaining
time
Yes
I
understand
continued
the
Coroner
deliberately
that
you
were
sitting
reading
on
the
bench
just
outside
the
long
window
of
the
boudoir
That
is
so
is
it
not
This
was
news
to
me
and
glancing
sideways
at
I
fancied
that
it
was
news
to
him
as
well
There
was
the
faintest
pause
the
mere
hesitation
of
a
moment
before
she
answered
Yes
that
is
so
And
the
boudoir
window
was
open
was
it
not
Surely
her
face
grew
a
little
paler
as
she
answered
Yes
Then
you
cannot
have
failed
to
hear
the
voices
inside
especially
as
they
were
raised
in
anger
In
fact
they
would
be
more
audible
where
you
were
than
in
the
hall
Possibly
Will
you
repeat
to
us
what
you
overheard
of
the
quarrel
I
really
do
not
remember
hearing
anything
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
not
hear
voices
Oh
yes
I
heard
the
voices
but
I
did
not
hear
what
they
said
A
faint
spot
of
colour
came
into
her
cheek
I
am
not
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
private
conversations
The
Coroner
persisted
And
you
remember
nothing
at
all
Nothing
Mrs
Cavendish
Not
one
stray
word
or
phrase
to
make
you
realize
that
it
was
a
private
conversation
She
paused
and
seemed
to
reflect
still
outwardly
as
calm
as
ever
Yes
I
remember
Mrs
said
do
not
remember
exactly
causing
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
Ah
the
Coroner
leant
back
satisfied
That
corresponds
with
what
Dorcas
heard
But
excuse
me
Mrs
Cavendish
although
you
realized
it
was
a
private
conversation
you
did
not
move
away
You
remained
where
you
were
I
caught
the
momentary
gleam
of
her
tawny
eyes
as
she
raised
them
I
felt
certain
that
at
that
moment
she
would
willingly
have
torn
the
little
lawyer
with
his
insinuations
into
pieces
but
she
replied
quietly
enough
No
I
was
very
comfortable
where
I
was
I
fixed
my
mind
on
my
book
And
that
is
all
you
can
tell
us
That
is
all
The
examination
was
over
though
I
doubted
if
the
Coroner
was
entirely
satisfied
with
it
I
think
he
suspected
that
Mary
Cavendish
could
tell
more
if
she
chose
Amy
Hill
shop
assistant
was
next
called
and
deposed
to
having
sold
a
will
form
on
the
afternoon
of
the
to
William
Earl
at
Styles
William
Earl
and
Manning
succeeded
her
and
testified
to
witnessing
a
document
Manning
fixed
the
time
at
about
William
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
rather
earlier
Cynthia
came
next
She
had
however
little
to
tell
She
had
known
nothing
of
the
tragedy
until
awakened
by
Mrs
Cavendish
You
did
not
hear
the
table
fall
No
I
was
fast
asleep
The
Coroner
smiled
A
good
conscience
makes
a
sound
sleeper
he
observed
Thank
you
Miss
that
is
all
Miss
Miss
produced
the
letter
written
to
her
by
Mrs
on
the
evening
of
the
and
I
had
of
course
already
seen
it
It
added
nothing
to
our
knowledge
of
the
tragedy
The
following
is
a
facsimile
STYLES
COURT
hand
written
note
July
My
dear
Can
we
not
bury
the
I
have
found
it
hard
to
forgive
the
things
you
said
against
my
dear
husband
but
I
am
an
old
woman
very
fond
of
you
Yours
affectionately
Emily
It
was
handed
to
the
jury
who
scrutinized
it
attentively
I
fear
it
does
not
help
us
much
said
the
Coroner
with
a
sigh
There
is
no
mention
of
any
of
the
events
of
that
afternoon
Plain
as
a
pikestaff
to
me
said
Miss
shortly
It
shows
clearly
enough
that
my
poor
old
friend
had
just
found
out
shed
been
made
a
fool
of
It
says
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
letter
the
Coroner
pointed
out
No
because
Emily
never
could
bear
to
put
herself
in
the
wrong
But
I
know
her
She
wanted
me
back
But
she
wasnt
going
to
own
that
Id
been
right
She
went
round
about
Most
people
do
Dont
believe
in
it
myself
Mr
Wells
smiled
faintly
So
I
noticed
did
several
of
the
jury
Miss
was
obviously
quite
a
public
character
Anyway
all
this
tomfoolery
is
a
great
waste
of
time
continued
the
lady
glancing
up
and
down
the
jury
disparagingly
When
all
the
time
we
know
perfectly
well
The
Coroner
interrupted
her
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
Thank
you
Miss
that
is
all
I
fancy
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
complied
Then
came
the
sensation
of
the
day
The
Coroner
called
Albert
Mace
chemists
assistant
It
was
our
agitated
young
man
of
the
pale
face
In
answer
to
the
Coroners
questions
he
explained
that
he
was
a
qualified
pharmacist
but
had
only
recently
come
to
this
particular
shop
as
the
assistant
formerly
there
had
just
been
called
up
for
the
army
These
preliminaries
completed
the
Coroner
proceeded
to
business
Mr
Mace
have
you
lately
sold
strychnine
to
any
unauthorized
person
Yes
sir
When
was
this
Last
Monday
night
Monday
Not
Tuesday
No
sir
Monday
the
Will
you
tell
us
to
whom
you
sold
it
You
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
Yes
sir
It
was
to
Mr
Every
eye
turned
simultaneously
to
where
Alfred
was
sitting
impassive
and
wooden
He
started
slightly
as
the
damning
words
fell
from
the
young
mans
lips
I
half
thought
he
was
going
to
rise
from
his
chair
but
he
remained
seated
although
a
remarkably
well
acted
expression
of
astonishment
rose
on
his
face
You
are
sure
of
what
you
say
asked
the
Coroner
sternly
Quite
sure
sir
Are
you
in
the
habit
of
selling
strychnine
indiscriminately
over
the
counter
The
wretched
young
man
wilted
visibly
under
the
Coroners
frown
Oh
no
course
not
But
seeing
it
was
Mr
of
the
Hall
I
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
it
He
said
it
was
to
poison
a
dog
Inwardly
I
sympathized
It
was
only
human
nature
to
endeavour
to
please
The
when
it
might
result
in
custom
being
transferred
from
Coots
to
the
local
establishment
Is
it
not
customary
for
anyone
purchasing
poison
to
sign
a
book
Yes
sir
Mr
did
so
Have
you
got
the
book
here
Yes
sir
It
was
produced
and
with
a
few
words
of
stern
censure
the
Coroner
dismissed
the
wretched
Mr
Mace
Then
amidst
a
breathless
silence
Alfred
was
called
Did
he
realize
I
wondered
how
closely
the
halter
was
being
drawn
around
his
neck
The
Coroner
went
straight
to
the
point
On
Monday
evening
last
did
you
purchase
strychnine
for
the
purpose
of
poisoning
a
dog
replied
with
perfect
calmness
No
I
did
not
There
is
no
dog
at
Styles
except
an
outdoor
sheepdog
which
is
in
perfect
health
You
deny
absolutely
having
purchased
strychnine
from
Albert
Mace
on
Monday
last
I
do
Do
you
also
deny
this
The
Coroner
handed
him
the
register
in
which
his
signature
was
inscribed
Certainly
I
do
The
handwriting
is
quite
different
from
mine
I
will
show
you
He
took
an
old
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
and
wrote
his
name
on
it
handing
it
to
the
jury
It
was
certainly
utterly
dissimilar
Then
what
is
your
explanation
of
Mr
Maces
statement
Alfred
replied
Mr
Mace
must
have
been
mistaken
The
Coroner
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
Mr
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
would
you
mind
telling
us
where
you
were
on
the
evening
of
Monday
July
cant
remember
That
is
absurd
Mr
said
the
Coroner
sharply
Think
again
shook
his
head
I
cannot
tell
you
I
have
an
idea
that
I
was
out
walking
In
what
direction
I
really
cant
remember
The
Coroners
face
grew
graver
Were
you
in
company
with
anyone
No
Did
you
meet
anyone
on
your
walk
No
That
is
a
pity
said
the
Coroner
I
am
to
take
it
then
that
you
decline
to
say
where
you
were
at
the
time
that
Mr
Mace
positively
recognized
you
as
entering
the
shop
to
purchase
strychnine
If
you
like
to
take
it
that
way
yes
Be
careful
Mr
was
fidgeting
nervously
Sacre
he
murmured
Does
this
imbecile
of
a
man
want
to
be
arrested
was
indeed
creating
a
bad
impression
His
futile
denials
would
not
have
convinced
a
child
The
Coroner
however
passed
briskly
to
the
next
point
and
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
You
had
a
discussion
with
your
wife
on
Tuesday
afternoon
Pardon
me
interrupted
Alfred
you
have
been
misinformed
I
had
no
quarrel
with
my
dear
wife
The
whole
story
is
absolutely
untrue
I
was
absent
from
the
house
the
entire
afternoon
Have
you
anyone
who
can
testify
to
that
You
have
my
word
said
The
Coroner
did
not
trouble
to
reply
There
are
two
witnesses
who
will
swear
to
having
heard
your
disagreement
with
Mrs
Those
witnesses
were
mistaken
I
was
puzzled
The
man
spoke
with
such
quiet
assurance
that
I
was
staggered
I
looked
at
There
was
an
expression
of
exultation
on
his
face
which
I
could
not
understand
Was
he
at
last
convinced
of
Alfred
guilt
Mr
said
the
Coroner
you
have
heard
your
wifes
dying
words
repeated
here
Can
you
explain
them
in
any
way
Certainly
I
can
You
can
It
seems
to
me
very
simple
The
room
was
dimly
lighted
Dr
is
much
of
my
height
and
build
and
like
me
wears
a
beard
In
the
dim
light
and
suffering
as
she
was
my
poor
wife
mistook
him
for
me
Ah
murmured
to
himself
But
it
is
an
idea
that
You
think
it
is
true
I
whispered
I
do
not
say
that
But
it
is
truly
an
ingenious
supposition
You
read
my
wifes
last
words
as
an
was
were
on
the
contrary
an
appeal
to
me
The
Coroner
reflected
a
moment
then
he
said
I
believe
Mr
that
you
yourself
poured
out
the
coffee
and
took
it
to
your
wife
that
evening
I
poured
it
out
yes
But
I
did
not
take
it
to
her
I
meant
to
do
so
but
I
was
told
that
a
friend
was
at
the
hall
door
so
I
laid
down
the
coffee
on
the
hall
table
When
I
came
through
the
hall
again
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
gone
This
statement
might
or
might
not
be
true
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
improve
matters
much
for
In
any
case
he
had
had
ample
time
to
introduce
the
poison
At
that
point
nudged
me
gently
indicating
two
men
who
were
sitting
together
near
the
door
One
was
a
little
sharp
dark
man
the
other
was
tall
and
fair
I
questioned
mutely
He
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
Do
you
know
who
that
little
man
is
I
shook
my
head
That
is
Detective
Inspector
James
of
Scotland
The
other
man
is
from
Scotland
Yard
too
Things
are
moving
quickly
my
friend
I
stared
at
the
two
men
intently
There
was
certainly
nothing
of
the
policeman
about
them
I
should
never
have
suspected
them
of
being
official
personages
I
was
still
staring
when
I
was
startled
and
recalled
by
the
verdict
being
given
Wilful
Murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
As
we
came
out
of
the
Arms
drew
me
aside
by
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
arm
I
understood
his
object
He
was
waiting
for
the
Scotland
Yard
men
In
a
few
moments
they
emerged
and
at
once
stepped
forward
and
accosted
the
shorter
of
the
two
I
fear
you
do
not
remember
me
Inspector
Why
if
it
isnt
Mr
cried
the
Inspector
He
turned
to
the
other
man
Youve
heard
me
speak
of
Mr
It
was
in
he
and
I
worked
forgery
remember
he
was
run
down
in
Brussels
Ah
those
were
great
days
Then
do
you
remember
Baron
There
was
a
pretty
rogue
for
you
He
eluded
the
clutches
of
half
the
police
in
Europe
But
we
nailed
him
in
to
Mr
here
As
these
friendly
reminiscences
were
being
indulged
in
I
drew
nearer
and
was
introduced
to
who
in
his
turn
introduced
us
both
to
his
companion
Superintendent
I
need
hardly
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
gentlemen
remarked
closed
one
eye
knowingly
No
indeed
Pretty
clear
case
I
should
say
But
answered
gravely
There
I
differ
from
you
Oh
come
said
opening
his
lips
for
the
first
time
Surely
the
whole
thing
is
clear
as
daylight
The
mans
caught
How
he
could
be
such
a
fool
beats
me
But
was
looking
attentively
at
Hold
your
fire
he
remarked
Me
and
here
have
met
theres
no
mans
judgment
Id
sooner
take
than
his
If
Im
not
greatly
mistaken
hes
got
something
up
his
sleeve
Isnt
that
so
smiled
I
have
drawn
certain
was
still
looking
rather
sceptical
but
continued
his
scrutiny
of
Its
this
way
he
said
so
far
weve
only
seen
the
case
from
the
outside
Thats
where
the
Yards
at
a
disadvantage
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
the
murders
only
out
so
to
speak
after
the
inquest
A
lot
depends
on
being
on
the
spot
first
thing
and
thats
where
Mr
had
the
start
of
us
We
shouldnt
have
been
here
as
soon
as
this
even
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
smart
doctor
on
the
spot
who
gave
us
the
tip
through
the
Coroner
But
youve
been
on
the
spot
from
the
first
and
you
may
have
picked
up
some
little
hints
From
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
Mr
murdered
his
wife
as
sure
as
I
stand
here
and
if
anyone
but
you
hinted
the
contrary
Id
laugh
in
his
face
I
must
say
I
was
surprised
the
jury
didnt
bring
it
in
Wilful
Murder
against
him
right
off
I
think
they
would
have
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
seemed
to
be
holding
them
back
Perhaps
though
you
have
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
in
your
pocket
now
suggested
A
kind
of
wooden
shutter
of
officialdom
came
down
from
expressive
countenance
Perhaps
I
have
and
perhaps
I
havent
he
remarked
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
I
am
very
anxious
Messieurs
that
he
should
not
be
arrested
I
dare
say
observed
sarcastically
was
regarding
with
comical
Cant
you
go
a
little
further
Mr
A
winks
as
good
as
a
you
Youve
been
on
the
the
Yard
doesnt
want
to
make
any
mistakes
you
know
nodded
gravely
That
is
exactly
what
I
thought
Well
I
will
tell
you
this
Use
your
warrant
Arrest
Mr
But
it
will
bring
you
no
case
against
him
will
be
dismissed
at
once
Comme
ca
And
he
snapped
his
fingers
expressively
face
grew
grave
though
gave
an
incredulous
snort
As
for
me
I
was
literally
dumb
with
astonishment
I
could
only
conclude
that
was
mad
had
taken
out
a
handkerchief
and
was
gently
dabbing
his
brow
I
do
it
Mr
Id
take
your
word
but
theres
others
over
me
wholl
be
asking
what
the
devil
I
mean
by
it
Cant
you
give
me
a
little
more
to
go
on
reflected
a
moment
It
can
be
done
he
said
at
last
I
admit
I
do
not
wish
it
It
forces
my
hand
I
would
have
preferred
to
work
in
the
dark
just
for
the
present
but
what
you
say
is
very
word
of
a
Belgian
policeman
whose
day
is
past
is
not
enough
And
Alfred
must
not
be
arrested
That
I
have
sworn
as
my
friend
Hastings
here
knows
See
then
my
good
you
go
at
once
to
Styles
Well
in
about
half
an
hour
Were
seeing
the
Coroner
and
the
doctor
first
Good
Call
for
me
in
last
house
in
the
village
I
will
go
with
you
At
Styles
Mr
will
give
you
or
if
he
is
will
give
you
such
proofs
that
shall
satisfy
you
that
the
case
against
him
could
not
possibly
be
sustained
Is
that
a
bargain
Thats
a
bargain
said
heartily
And
on
behalf
of
the
Yard
Im
much
obliged
to
you
though
Im
bound
to
confess
I
cant
at
present
see
the
faintest
possible
loophole
in
the
evidence
but
you
always
were
a
marvel
So
long
then
The
two
detectives
strode
away
with
an
incredulous
grin
on
his
face
Well
my
friend
cried
before
I
could
get
in
a
word
what
do
you
think
Mon
I
had
some
warm
moments
in
that
court
I
did
not
figure
to
myself
that
the
man
would
be
so
pigheaded
as
to
refuse
to
say
anything
at
all
Decidedly
it
was
the
policy
of
an
imbecile
Hm
There
are
other
explanations
besides
that
of
imbecility
I
remarked
For
if
the
case
against
him
is
true
how
could
he
defend
himself
except
by
silence
Why
in
a
thousand
ingenious
ways
cried
See
say
that
it
is
I
who
have
committed
this
murder
I
can
think
of
seven
most
plausible
stories
Far
more
convincing
than
Mr
stony
denials
I
could
not
help
laughing
My
dear
I
am
sure
you
are
capable
of
thinking
of
seventy
But
seriously
in
spite
of
what
I
heard
you
say
to
the
detectives
you
surely
cannot
still
believe
in
the
possibility
of
Alfred
innocence
Why
not
now
as
much
as
before
Nothing
has
changed
But
the
evidence
is
so
conclusive
Yes
too
conclusive
We
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
Leastways
Cottage
and
proceeded
up
the
now
familiar
stairs
Yes
yes
too
conclusive
continued
almost
to
himself
Real
evidence
is
usually
vague
and
unsatisfactory
It
has
to
be
But
here
the
whole
thing
is
cut
and
dried
No
my
friend
this
evidence
has
been
very
cleverly
cleverly
that
it
has
defeated
its
own
ends
How
do
you
make
that
out
Because
so
long
as
the
evidence
against
him
was
vague
and
intangible
it
was
very
hard
to
disprove
But
in
his
anxiety
the
criminal
has
drawn
the
net
so
closely
that
one
cut
will
set
free
I
was
silent
And
in
a
minute
or
two
continued
Let
us
look
at
the
matter
like
this
Here
is
a
man
let
us
say
who
sets
out
to
poison
his
wife
He
has
lived
by
his
wits
as
the
saying
goes
Presumably
therefore
he
has
some
wits
He
is
not
altogether
a
fool
Well
how
does
he
set
about
it
He
goes
boldly
to
the
village
chemists
and
purchases
strychnine
under
his
own
name
with
a
trumped
up
story
about
a
dog
which
is
bound
to
be
proved
absurd
He
does
not
employ
the
poison
that
night
No
he
waits
until
he
has
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
her
of
which
the
whole
household
is
and
which
naturally
directs
their
suspicions
upon
him
He
prepares
no
shadow
of
an
alibi
yet
he
knows
the
chemists
assistant
must
necessarily
come
forward
with
the
facts
Bah
do
not
ask
me
to
believe
that
any
man
could
be
so
idiotic
Only
a
lunatic
who
wished
to
commit
suicide
by
causing
himself
to
be
hanged
would
act
so
do
not
see
I
began
Neither
do
I
see
I
tell
you
mon
ami
it
puzzles
me
But
if
you
believe
him
innocent
how
do
you
explain
his
buying
the
strychnine
Very
simply
He
did
not
buy
it
But
Mace
recognized
him
I
beg
your
pardon
he
saw
a
man
with
a
black
beard
like
Mr
and
wearing
glasses
like
Mr
and
dressed
in
Mr
rather
noticeable
clothes
He
could
not
recognize
a
man
whom
he
had
probably
only
seen
in
the
distance
since
you
remember
he
himself
had
only
been
in
the
village
a
fortnight
and
Mrs
dealt
principally
with
Coots
in
Then
you
think
Mon
ami
do
you
remember
the
two
points
I
laid
stress
upon
Leave
the
first
one
for
the
moment
what
was
the
second
The
important
fact
that
Alfred
wears
peculiar
clothes
has
a
black
beard
and
uses
glasses
I
quoted
Exactly
Now
suppose
anyone
wished
to
pass
himself
off
as
John
or
Lawrence
Cavendish
Would
it
be
easy
No
I
said
thoughtfully
Of
course
an
actor
But
cut
me
short
ruthlessly
And
why
would
it
not
be
easy
I
will
tell
you
my
friend
Because
they
are
both
men
To
make
up
successfully
as
one
of
these
two
in
broad
daylight
it
would
need
an
actor
of
genius
and
a
certain
initial
facial
resemblance
But
in
the
case
of
Alfred
all
that
is
changed
His
clothes
his
beard
the
glasses
which
hide
his
are
the
salient
points
about
his
personal
appearance
Now
what
is
the
first
instinct
of
the
criminal
To
divert
suspicion
from
himself
is
it
not
so
And
how
can
he
best
do
that
By
throwing
it
on
some
one
else
In
this
instance
there
was
a
man
ready
to
his
hand
Everybody
was
predisposed
to
believe
in
Mr
guilt
It
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
would
be
suspected
but
to
make
it
a
sure
thing
there
must
be
tangible
as
the
actual
buying
of
the
poison
and
that
with
a
man
of
the
peculiar
appearance
of
Mr
was
not
difficult
Remember
this
young
Mace
had
never
actually
spoken
to
Mr
How
should
he
doubt
that
the
man
in
his
clothes
with
his
beard
and
his
glasses
was
not
Alfred
It
may
be
so
I
said
fascinated
by
eloquence
But
if
that
was
the
case
why
does
he
not
say
where
he
was
at
six
oclock
on
Monday
evening
Ah
why
indeed
said
calming
down
If
he
were
arrested
he
probably
would
speak
but
I
do
not
want
it
to
come
to
that
I
must
make
him
see
the
gravity
of
his
position
There
is
of
course
something
discreditable
behind
his
silence
If
he
did
not
murder
his
wife
he
is
nevertheless
a
scoundrel
and
has
something
of
his
own
to
conceal
quite
apart
from
the
murder
What
can
it
be
I
mused
won
over
to
views
for
the
moment
although
still
retaining
a
faint
conviction
that
the
obvious
deduction
was
the
correct
one
Can
you
not
guess
asked
smiling
No
can
you
Oh
yes
I
had
a
little
idea
sometime
it
has
turned
out
to
be
correct
You
never
told
me
I
said
spread
out
his
hands
Pardon
me
mon
ami
you
were
not
precisely
sympathique
He
turned
to
me
earnestly
Tell
see
now
that
he
must
not
be
arrested
Perhaps
I
said
doubtfully
for
I
was
really
quite
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
Alfred
and
thought
that
a
good
fright
would
do
him
no
harm
who
was
watching
me
intently
gave
a
sigh
Come
my
friend
he
said
changing
the
subject
apart
from
Mr
how
did
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
strike
you
Oh
pretty
much
what
I
expected
Did
nothing
strike
you
as
peculiar
about
it
My
thoughts
flew
to
Mary
Cavendish
and
I
hedged
In
what
way
Well
Mr
Lawrence
evidence
for
instance
I
was
relieved
Oh
Lawrence
No
I
dont
think
so
Hes
always
a
nervous
chap
His
suggestion
that
his
mother
might
have
been
poisoned
accidentally
by
means
of
the
tonic
she
was
taking
that
did
not
strike
you
as
No
I
cant
say
it
did
The
doctors
ridiculed
it
of
course
But
it
was
quite
a
natural
suggestion
for
a
layman
to
make
But
Monsieur
Lawrence
is
not
a
layman
You
told
me
yourself
that
he
had
started
by
studying
medicine
and
that
he
had
taken
his
degree
Yes
thats
true
I
never
thought
of
that
I
was
rather
startled
It
is
odd
nodded
From
the
first
his
behaviour
has
been
peculiar
Of
all
the
household
he
alone
would
be
likely
to
recognize
the
symptoms
of
strychnine
poisoning
and
yet
we
find
him
the
only
member
of
the
family
to
uphold
strenuously
the
theory
of
death
from
natural
causes
If
it
had
been
Monsieur
John
I
could
have
understood
it
He
has
no
technical
knowledge
and
is
by
nature
unimaginative
But
Monsieur
And
now
today
he
puts
forward
a
suggestion
that
he
himself
must
have
known
was
ridiculous
There
is
food
for
thought
in
this
mon
ami
Its
very
confusing
I
agreed
Then
there
is
Mrs
Cavendish
continued
Thats
another
who
is
not
telling
all
she
knows
What
do
you
make
of
her
attitude
I
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
It
seems
inconceivable
that
she
should
be
shielding
Alfred
Yet
that
is
what
it
looks
like
nodded
reflectively
Yes
it
is
queer
One
thing
is
certain
she
overheard
a
good
deal
more
of
that
private
conversation
than
she
was
willing
to
admit
And
yet
she
is
the
last
person
one
would
accuse
of
stooping
to
eavesdrop
Exactly
One
thing
her
evidence
has
shown
me
I
made
a
mistake
Dorcas
was
quite
right
The
quarrel
did
take
place
earlier
in
the
afternoon
about
four
oclock
as
she
said
I
looked
at
him
curiously
I
had
never
understood
his
insistence
on
that
point
Yes
a
good
deal
that
was
peculiar
came
out
today
continued
Dr
now
what
was
he
doing
up
and
dressed
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
It
is
astonishing
to
me
that
no
one
commented
on
the
fact
He
has
insomnia
I
believe
I
said
doubtfully
Which
is
a
very
good
or
a
very
bad
explanation
remarked
It
covers
everything
and
explains
nothing
I
shall
keep
my
eye
on
our
clever
Dr
Any
more
faults
to
find
with
the
evidence
I
inquired
Mon
ami
replied
gravely
when
you
find
that
people
are
not
telling
you
the
out
Now
unless
I
am
much
mistaken
at
the
inquest
today
only
most
two
persons
were
speaking
the
truth
without
reservation
or
subterfuge
Oh
come
now
I
wont
cite
Lawrence
or
Mrs
Cavendish
But
theres
Miss
surely
they
were
speaking
the
truth
Both
of
them
my
friend
One
I
grant
you
but
both
His
words
gave
me
an
unpleasant
shock
Miss
evidence
unimportant
as
it
was
had
been
given
in
such
a
downright
straightforward
manner
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
her
sincerity
Still
I
had
a
great
respect
for
on
the
occasions
when
he
was
what
I
described
to
myself
as
foolishly
pigheaded
Do
you
really
think
so
I
asked
Miss
had
always
seemed
to
me
so
essentially
uncomfortably
so
gave
me
a
curious
look
which
I
could
not
quite
fathom
He
seemed
to
speak
and
then
checked
himself
Miss
too
I
continued
theres
nothing
untruthful
about
her
No
But
it
was
strange
that
she
never
heard
a
sound
sleeping
next
door
whereas
Mrs
Cavendish
in
the
other
wing
of
the
building
distinctly
heard
the
table
fall
Well
shes
young
And
she
sleeps
soundly
Ah
yes
indeed
She
must
be
a
famous
sleeper
that
one
I
did
not
quite
like
the
tone
of
his
voice
but
at
that
moment
a
smart
knock
reached
our
ears
and
looking
out
of
the
window
we
perceived
the
two
detectives
waiting
for
us
below
seized
his
hat
gave
a
ferocious
twist
to
his
moustache
and
carefully
brushing
an
imaginary
speck
of
dust
from
his
sleeve
motioned
me
to
precede
him
down
the
stairs
there
we
joined
the
detectives
and
set
out
for
Styles
I
think
the
appearance
of
the
two
Scotland
Yard
men
was
rather
a
to
John
though
of
course
after
the
verdict
he
had
realized
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
Still
the
presence
of
the
detectives
brought
the
truth
home
to
him
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
had
conferred
with
in
a
low
tone
on
the
way
up
and
it
was
the
latter
functionary
who
requested
that
the
household
with
the
exception
of
the
servants
should
be
assembled
together
in
the
I
realized
the
significance
of
this
It
was
up
to
to
make
his
boast
good
Personally
I
was
not
sanguine
might
have
excellent
reasons
for
his
belief
in
innocence
but
a
man
of
the
type
of
would
require
tangible
proofs
and
these
I
doubted
if
could
supply
Before
very
long
we
had
all
trooped
into
the
the
door
of
which
closed
politely
set
chairs
for
every
one
The
Scotland
Yard
men
were
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
I
think
that
for
the
first
time
we
realized
that
the
thing
was
not
a
bad
dream
but
a
tangible
reality
We
had
read
of
such
we
ourselves
were
actors
in
the
drama
Tomorrow
the
daily
papers
all
over
England
would
blazon
out
the
news
in
staring
headlines
MYSTERIOUS
TRAGEDY
IN
WEALTHY
LADY
POISONED
There
would
be
pictures
of
Styles
snapshots
of
The
family
leaving
the
village
photographer
had
not
been
idle
All
the
things
that
one
had
read
a
hundred
times
things
that
happen
to
other
people
not
to
oneself
And
now
in
this
house
a
murder
had
been
committed
In
front
of
us
were
the
detectives
in
charge
of
the
case
The
glib
phraseology
passed
rapidly
through
my
mind
in
the
interval
before
opened
the
proceedings
I
think
every
one
was
a
little
surprised
that
it
should
be
he
and
not
one
of
the
official
detectives
who
took
the
initiative
Mesdames
and
messieurs
said
bowing
as
though
he
were
a
celebrity
about
to
deliver
a
lecture
I
have
asked
you
to
come
here
all
together
for
a
certain
object
That
object
it
concerns
Mr
Alfred
was
sitting
a
little
by
think
unconsciously
every
one
had
drawn
his
chair
slightly
away
from
he
gave
a
faint
start
as
pronounced
his
name
Mr
said
addressing
him
directly
a
very
dark
shadow
is
resting
on
this
shadow
of
murder
shook
his
head
sadly
My
poor
wife
he
murmured
Poor
Emily
It
is
terrible
I
do
not
think
monsieur
said
pointedly
that
you
quite
realize
how
terrible
it
may
you
And
as
did
not
appear
to
understand
he
added
Mr
you
are
standing
in
very
grave
danger
The
two
detectives
I
saw
the
official
caution
Anything
you
say
will
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
actually
hovering
on
lips
went
on
Do
you
understand
now
monsieur
No
What
do
you
mean
I
mean
said
deliberately
that
you
are
suspected
of
poisoning
your
wife
A
little
gasp
ran
round
the
circle
at
this
plain
speaking
Good
heavens
cried
starting
up
What
a
monstrous
idea
my
dearest
Emily
I
do
not
watched
him
you
quite
realize
the
unfavourable
nature
of
your
evidence
at
the
inquest
Mr
knowing
what
I
have
now
told
you
do
you
still
refuse
to
say
where
you
were
at
six
oclock
on
Monday
afternoon
With
a
groan
Alfred
sank
down
again
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
approached
and
stood
over
him
Speak
he
cried
menacingly
With
an
effort
raised
his
face
from
his
hands
Then
slowly
and
deliberately
he
shook
his
head
You
will
not
speak
No
I
do
not
believe
that
anyone
could
be
so
monstrous
as
to
accuse
me
of
what
you
say
nodded
thoughtfully
like
a
man
whose
mind
is
made
up
he
said
Then
I
must
speak
for
you
Alfred
sprang
up
again
You
How
can
you
speak
You
do
not
know
he
broke
off
abruptly
turned
to
face
us
Mesdames
and
messieurs
I
speak
Listen
I
affirm
that
the
man
who
entered
the
chemists
shop
and
purchased
strychnine
at
six
oclock
on
Monday
last
was
not
Mr
for
at
six
oclock
on
that
day
Mr
was
escorting
Mrs
back
to
her
home
from
a
neighbouring
farm
I
can
produce
no
less
than
five
witnesses
to
swear
to
having
seen
them
together
either
at
six
or
just
after
and
as
you
may
know
the
Abbey
Farm
Mrs
home
is
at
least
two
and
a
half
miles
distant
from
the
village
